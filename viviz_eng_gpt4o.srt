1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
VIVIZ High School Welcomes the New School Year of 2024

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Kim Ye-won arrives at school - Top student at VIVIZ High School - Seems to have a hidden past.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,060
Teacher: As expected, Ye-won

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Arriving first like a model student

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hwang Eun-bi arrives at school - Sophomore class 5's popular girl and cool girl - Loves dancing

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Steps gradually slow down for some reason...

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,460
Teacher: Hwang Eun-bi, come here

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,620 
Teacher: Where is Eun-bi's tie?

9
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,880
Teacher: Penalty points for improper attire, 3 points

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,880
Teacher: Take care of it

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,880
Shinbi: Goodbye

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Penalty, 3 points. Hwang Eun-bi arrives at school

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Only 5 minutes left until school start time

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Run, Eun-bi

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,880
Heh / Jung Eun-bi arrives - Cute but clumsy - Sometimes makes sharp criticisms

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,880
Teacher: Let's go. If she’s here, everyone should be here.

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,880
What will happen at VIVIZ High School?

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,880
Classroom for sophomore class 5

19
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,880
Model student Ye-won arrives first

20
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,880
Sitting near the teacher as expected of a model student

21
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,880
Half excitement, half nervousness

22
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,880
Other students gradually arrive too

23
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,000
An awkward air fills the new semester classroom

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I want to make friends

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
At that moment, the door opens

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Eun-bi, where did you get that tie?

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
(Hwang) Eun-bi naturally heads to the back seat

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Shinbi: Oh, you’re in class 5 too!

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,160
Shinbi: Do you know her?

30
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,340
Shinbi: Hi

31
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,000
Friends exchange shy first greetings

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,760
Shinbi: So pretty~

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Ha ha ha

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,240
Eunha: If I hadn’t had that slice of bread, I wouldn’t have been able to open the door

35
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,000
(Jung) Eun-bi also manages to arrive at school

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,240
But the classroom remains silent...

37
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,240
Eunha: Are you by any chance Hwang Eun-bi from Cheonan North Middle School?

38
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,000
Shinbi: Jung Eun-bi from Sinnam Middle School?

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,240
Oh my...!

40
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,240
Just heard about you. I’ve heard a lot.

41
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,240
Eunha: You really wanted to be friends, huh?

42
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,240
Shinbi: Do you know her?

43
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,240
Fully focused body

44
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,240
Shinbi: Sistar from Sinsong Middle School

45
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,000
[Huh]

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,240
Eunha: Kim Ye-won...! No way, that...that...!

47
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,240
Eunha: The one who danced to 'So Cool'?

48
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,240
Shinbi: She doesn’t dance anymore

49
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,240
(Forgotten past of Sinsong Middle School's Sistar)

50
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,240
Eunha: Is she studying?

51
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,240
Shinbi: Suddenly got her act together in high school

52
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,240
Ye-won: Very proactive.

53
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,240
Shinbi: She’s got some pride

54
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,240
Eunha: Seems a bit conceited too, a bit

55
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,240
Shinbi: She’s reading an English book

56
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,240
Will school life be okay?

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,240
Then, the homeroom teacher of Class 2-5 makes an appearance.

58
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,240
Teacher: Everyone is seated very nicely.

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Teacher: The class president needs to...

60
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,240
Teacher: There’s no class president.

61
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,240
Shinbi: There's no class president.

62
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,240
Teacher: Should we choose a class president?

63
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,240
Teacher: Should we start by accepting nominations from those who want to run for class president?

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Everyone is looking around, hesitant.

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,240
Kim Yewon: I volunteer for the class president election.

66
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,240
Teacher: Yewon again?

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,240
Friend: I nominate Hwang Eunbi.

68
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,240
Shinbi: Seriously, what's wrong with them?

69
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,000
Shinbi: What's going on?

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,240
Teacher: Since Hwang Eunbi is nominated...

71
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,240
Telepathy

72
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,240
Eunha: I, I will also run.

73
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,240
Teacher: Okay, Jeong Eunbi as well.

74
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,240
Teacher: So, we have three candidates.

75
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,240
Teacher: Let's hear their campaign promises, shall we?

76
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,240
Umji: Hello.

77
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,240
Umji: My name is Kim Yewon and,

78
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,240
Umji: given the current situation,

79
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,240
Umji: I will do my best to create a good night atmosphere so that we can focus on our studies this year.

80
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
Shinbi: What situation are you talking about?

81
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,240
Failed to immerse.

82
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,240
Umji: I will do my best to create a good environment for studying at night.

83
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,240
Umji: Please support me.

84
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,240
Umji: Thank you.

85
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,240
Shinbi: Wait a second.

86
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,240
Shinbi: I think a campaign promise is where you talk about what you will do.

87
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,240
Shinbi: Isn't it?

88
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,240
Umji: Oh, campaign promises.

89
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,240
Umji: I’ve been taking notes lately,

90
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,240
Umji: and I will share them with friends who need them.

91
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,240
Eunha: Huh?

92
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,240
Eunha: Then, how are your grades?

93
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,240
Shinbi: She was number one in the entire school last year.

94
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,000
In fact, Yewon maintained the number one spot in the entire school last year.

95
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,240
Umji: That’s not true. I didn’t do well in my studies during middle school.

96
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,240
Shinbi: Can I ask something I’m really curious about?

97
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,240
Shinbi: Are you the Sistar from Shinsong Middle School?

98
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,240
Shinbi: Are you the Sistar from Shinsong Middle School?

99
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,240
And so, the scandalous past is revealed.

100
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,000
Kim Yewon is pretending to be a model student once again.

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Shinbi: Was it 'So Cool'?

102
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Umji: No, I never did anything like that.

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Shinbi: Aw, that’s boring. I was going to vote for you.

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Umji: Anyway, since we’ll be seniors next year,

105
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Umji: I hope everyone will focus on studying. Goodbye!

106
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Exiting while leaving behind massive curiosity, Yewon.

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What on earth happened at Shinsong Middle School that year?

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,240
SinB: Hi, I'm Hwang Eun Bi.

109
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
SinB: *claps*

110
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,240
SinB: Even though we're in the second year of high school,

111
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,240
SinB: I hope we don't take things too seriously.

112
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,240
SinB: If I become the class president,

113
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,240
SinB: I'll get rid of self-study time.

114
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,240
SinB: (looking at the teacher for permission while speaking)

115
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The top student objects.

116
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
SinB: This is my time now.

117
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,240
SinB: It's my turn.

118
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,240
SinB: Did you see my leadership?

119
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,240
*overwhelms everyone*

120
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,240
SinB: How about we replace self-study time

121
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,240
SinB: with some free time to do what we want?

122
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
Umji: Can we do things other than studying during free time?

123
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,240
SinB: I'll dance.

124
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
Ohhh!

125
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,240
Eunha: Oh, then can you show us a dance first?

126
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,240
SinB: Sure.

127
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,240
*showing off*

128
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,240
SinB: This is a dance called "MANIAC" that's trending these days.

129
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
SinB: If I become the class president,

130
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,240
SinB: I'll teach you guys.

131
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,240
Umji: My hidden dance instincts are awakening.

132
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,240
SinB: I want our class to be

133
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,240
SinB: the most active class in the whole school.

134
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,240
SinB: Please give me applause, I'm done now.

135
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,240
*charisma*

136
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,240
SinB: Thank you.

137
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,240
Eunha: It's been over ten years since I've last done a class president election.

138
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,240
Eunha: I mean, the last time was during elementary school.

139
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,240
SinB: Oh, but I have a question.

140
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,240
SinB: Is that your natural hair color?

141
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,000
Eunbi's unusually bright hair.

142
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,240
(a question shaking the foundations)

143
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,240
SinB: Are you mixed race?

144
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
Eunha: Yes, I am.

145
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,240
Umji: Where are you from?

146
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,240
Eunha: Let me introduce myself.

147
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,000
Eunha: I'll announce my promises.

148
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,240
Eunha: Hi, I'm Jung Eun Bi.

149
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,240
Eunha: The promises I have prepared are
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
150
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,240
Eunha: Recently, I've been running a burger truck game called "My Little Chef."

151
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,240
Eunha: If I become the class president,

152
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,240
Eunha: I want to go eat burgers together.

153
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,240
SinB: How many times?

154
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Eunbi finds it too difficult...

155
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,240
SinB: Surely it's not just once? / Eunha: How many times should we go?

156
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,240
Eunha: I'm still just a student...

157
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,240
Umji: What if I can't eat flour?

158
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,240
SinB: Oh, really?

159
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
SinB: Oh no.

160
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,240
The entire universe is against Jung Eun Bi becoming class president.

161
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,240
Eunha: How about going to Lotteria to eat a rice burger?

162
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,240
Umji: Oh, that sounds like a good idea.

163
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,240
Eunha: Sure.

164
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,240
quora: Q. Is there a place selling the discontinued Lotteria rice burger? A. No.

165
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,240
Eunha: Then, please take care of me, everyone.

167
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,240
SinB: The votes are going to be split clearly, I think?

168
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,240
Teacher: Everyone close your eyes.

169
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,240
Teacher: If you open your eyes, I will see you.

170
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,240
Teacher: Raise your hand if you want Yewon to be the class president.

171
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,240
Election assurance

172
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,240
Teacher: Raise your hand if you want Hwang Eun-bi to be the class president, and if you want to dance.

173
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Hwang Eun-bi

174
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And

175
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The top student in school who needs an excuse to dance

176
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,240
Hwang Eun-bi, two votes

177
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,000
Teacher: Lastly, our Jung Eun-bi

178
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,240
Teacher: Got it.

179
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,240
Teacher: Shall we all open our eyes?

180
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,240
Excitedly

181
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,240
Teacher: Yewon

182
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Teacher: became the class president.

183
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,240
SinB: No way

184
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,240
Eunha: Video review, video review!

185
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,500
Eunha: This isn't right, we need a video review!

186
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,240
Eunbi's group can't accept the election result

187
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,240
Teacher: Let's check the results when we get home.

188
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,240
Eunha: Hey, this...

189
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
Eunha: Hey, no way, the teacher picked!

190
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,240
Eunha: The teacher picked it!

191
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,240
Eunha: Was it you?

192
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
SinB: Wait a moment

193
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,240
SinB: Wait a moment. Time out.

194
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,240
SinB: Time out.

195
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,240
SinB: Wait a moment.

196
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,240
SinB: Ah, wait a moment. Time out.

197
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,000
But really... who are you talking to?

198
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,240
Umji: I didn't know you were all so studious without showing it.

199
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,240
Eun-bi's group still can't comprehend the result

200
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,240
Umji: Actually, as it's a crucial time...

201
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,240
SinB: What do you mean what time?

202
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,240
Umji: To know how studious we are.

203
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,240
Umji: It was a pledge to test the waters a bit.

204
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,240
Umji: If I really become class president,

205
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,240
Umji: I'll ensure a good academic atmosphere

206
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,240
Umji: As well as the dance time that Hwang Eun-bi loves.

207
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,240
Umji: And Jung Eun-bi's

208
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,240
Umji: time to eat hamburgers.

209
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,240
Umji: I think this is what a class president should do.

210
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
The class president is the best

211
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,240
Thank you

212
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,240
Shin Song Middle School Sistar~!

213
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,240
Eunha: Since I'm the class president for a moment,

214
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,240
Eunha: please give us a congratulatory performance.

215
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,240
SinB: It's you, right?

216
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,240
SinB: The one with 10 million views.

217
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,240
Umji: Please take care of me.

218
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,240
Please take care of me.

219
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,240
Umji: Let's get along well, Class 2-5 friends.

220
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,240
Teacher: Yewon will energetically lead the class.

221
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,240
Teacher: We will start the first period after a 10-minute break.

222
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,240
Teacher: Let's have the class president erase the board.

223
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,240
Shall we get ready for the first lesson of the new semester?

224
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,240
SinB: Wait a moment

225
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,240
SinB: I just think the voting was wrong.

226
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,240
SinB: This can't be happening.

227
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,000
SinB: Because I thought it would be me.

228
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,240
Eunha: Are you doing an interview now?

229
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,240
Appealing unfairness to the fourth wall

230
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,240
SinB: I thought it would be me.

231
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,240
First Period: Morality Class

232
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,000
Eunha: Excited for the first class

233
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,240
Teacher: Okay, for the first period

234
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
Teacher: it’s morality class

235
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,240
Teacher: I'll give you a topic

236
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Teacher: and we'll split into teams to have a discussion based on that topic

237
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,240
Teacher: Now, the first topic

238
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
Teacher: If you could only live in 

239
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
Teacher: one season for the rest of your life,

240
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
Teacher: which season would you choose?

241
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,240
Teacher: Let’s start by making a choice.

242
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,240
SinB: Winter.

243
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,240
Teacher: Winter.

244
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,240
Eunbi: It's so hard to choose.

245
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,240
Umji: It's autumn.

246
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,240
SinB: Actually, I also like autumn the best.

247
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
Eunha: I like spring too.

248
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,240
Umji: But we have to pick between summer and winter.

249
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,240
Umji: I choose summer.

250
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
SinB: Summer.

251
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,240
Umji: Yeah.

252
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,240
I'll choose summer too.

253
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,240
Umji: Oh, it's a summer team here.

254
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,240
Eunha: I choose summer too.

255
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,240
SinB: Winter?

256
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
SinB: Summer?

257
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
SinB: It's clear-cut.

258
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,240
Teams split neatly as they were seated.

259
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,240
Teacher: Here is summer.

260
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,240
Teacher: Here is winter.

261
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,240
Eunha: Let's start the discussion.

262
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
Umji: First of all,

263
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,240
Umji: I have something to say.

264
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,240
Umji: You guys who ran for class president earlier,

265
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,240
Umji: I heard your birthday is around summer.

266
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,240
SinB: I wanted to be born in winter.

267
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,240
Umji: Oh, really?

268
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,240
Umji: Actually, I wanted to be born in autumn, too.

269
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,240
SinB: I had no choice but to come out in summer.

270
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,240
Umji: The reason I consider it important is

271
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,240
Umji: Is because of the fruits.

272
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,240
Total agreement

273
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,240
Umji: There are so many delicious fruits.

274
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,240
Umji: Especially watermelon.

275
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,240
Umji: Is there anyone here who can't eat watermelon?

276
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,240
SinB: I can't eat it because there isn't any.

277
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
Take a bite of watermelon, SWEET

278
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
Umji: Can't give up watermelon.

279
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,240
Eunha: Just like someone whose main diet is fruits.

280
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,240
Umji: Right, my family runs a fruit farm.

281
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,240
Eunha: Really? Your family owns a fruit farm?

282
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,240
Umji: The crops need to grow well.

283
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
Umji: It gets a bit tough in the winter.

284
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,000
Successfully voiced her opinion and promoted the family business.

285
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
SinB: The reason it's winter

286
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
SinB: is that you can layer up in winter.

287
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
SinB: But in summer, you can't just take everything off.

288
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,240
SinB: Besides, it's too humid, and our country is quite hot and humid.

289
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,000
SinB: Summer feels sticky, but winter is dry, yet comfortable.

290
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Umji: I thought you really hated dry weather?

291
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
SinB: No, it's not like that. Dry weather doesn't affect me as much.

292
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
SinB: I don't crack like you do.

293
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Umji: Well, I do have dry skin, Yewon.

294
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,240
SinB: You're 'Dry Skin Kim Yewon,' but I'm less of a 'Dry Skin Hwang Eunbi.'

295
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,000
Umji: Here we're talking about comfort,

296
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Umji: comparing winter heaters to summer air conditioners.

297
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Umji: Doesn't summer air conditioning make you feel a lot better and refreshed?

298
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
SinB: But I'm talking about going outside.

299
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,240
Umji: I know you as someone who prefers indoor activities.

300
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,240
SinB: Of course.

301
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,280
SinB: Why do you think I don't go out in summer?

302
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,520
SinB: It's because it's hot, humid, and sticky.

303
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,940
Umji: I thought you don't go out in winter either.

304
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,680
SinB: No, I go out a lot in winter.

305
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,120
SinB: I go out a lot in winter.

306
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,680
SinB: And there's more food to eat in winter.

307
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,920
Umji: What are you talking about?

308
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,960
SinB: Fish-shaped buns (Bungeoppang).

309
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,760
Eunha: There's more food in summer!

310
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,520
SinB: What? Other than watermelon, what is there?

311
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,220
Eunha: No!

312
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,460
SinB: Just watermelon, right?

313
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,400
Eunha: Samgyetang (ginseng chicken soup).

314
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,300
Eunha: Fighting heat with heat (Iyeolchiyeol).

315
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,600
SinB: Oh, it's hot, it's hot.

316
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,500
SinB: It'll cook you.

317
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
Umji: You like naengmyeon (cold noodles) too.

318
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,240
SinB: Naengmyeon?

319
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,400
SinB: Yeah, cold with cold (Inaengchinaeng).

320
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,300
SinB: I eat it in winter too.

321
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,100
Eunha: Fighting heat with heat.

322
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,500
SinB: I said I eat it in winter.

323
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,880
Umji: Fighting heat with heat.

324
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,680
Eunha: I'll just speak based on my standards.

325
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,480
Eunha: My cheeks hurt when the wind hits them.

326
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,980
An unexpectedly cute reason

327
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,220
Eunha: They hurt and turn red.

328
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,980
Umji: That's quite unfortunate.

329
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,420
SinB: I have another definite reason.

330
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,120
SinB: I...

331
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,520
SinB: I look prettier in winter.

332
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,520
Eunha: I'll speak based on my standards.

333
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,360
Eunha: I tend to look a bit prettier in summer.

334
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,460
SinB: But your pores open up in summer.

335
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,260
Eunha: Oh!

336
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:30,920
Eunha: Oh!

337
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,260
Umji: My pores are very...

338
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,760
Umji: small, so I'm fine.

339
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,620
Eunha: Oh!

340
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,660
Umji: This disagreement is still quite tense.

341
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,360
Umji: How about you guys?

342
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,660
Umji: Do you look prettier in summer, or in winter?

343
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,660
I tend to look prettier in winter.

344
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,340
Umji: You do give off a winter concept vibe.

345
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,540
SinB: Do you know why?

346
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,980
SinB: Your pores tighten in winter.

347
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,000
Perfect logic

348
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,480
Indeed, it was winter...

349
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,180
SinB: Your pores tighten in winter,

350
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:51,680
Eunha: They become elastic.

351
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,440
SinB: Yeah, they become more elastic.

352
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,380
Umji: You're selling me on this.

353
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,220
SinB: Right, isn't it?

354
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,880
Eunha: But honestly, I do like winter more.

355
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,580
Umji: Actually, I think I like winter more too.

356
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,160
Eunha: It's not that...

357
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,180
SinB: Guys, clap your hands.

358
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:00,880
Eunha: No, no.

359
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,680
Eunha: Listen to me.

360
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,960
Eunha: Think about this:

361
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,300
Eunha: No bugs...

362
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,300
SinB: It's clean...

363
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,660
Eunha: You can wear pajamas...

364
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,660
SinB: Teach, please wrap this up.

365
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,660
SinB: I think we won.

366
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,460
Teacher: So the conclusion is, there's more to eat in winter,

367
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,140
SinB: Adding 100 points to the beauty score

368
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,100
Teacher: So then...

369
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,940
Final Verdict: If you had to live in one season: Winter

370
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,900
Victory for less dry Hwang Eunbi!

371
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,680
Teacher: Now, for the second topic.

372
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,880
Teacher: Is knowledge power? Or is ignorance a remedy(bliss)?

373
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,460
SinB: This one's really tough.

374
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,420
Umji: I think knowledge is power...

375
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,260
Umji: ...is what I believe.

376
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,060
SinB: Same, power.

377
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,260
Eunha: Then I think ignorance

378
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,300
Eunha: is a remedy(bliss).

379
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,140
But then,

380
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,840
This person suddenly started acting suspiciously / Eunha: Honestly, I don't have much to say.

381
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,000
Why is Hwang Eunbi rummaging through the desk? / Eunha: Ignorance is a remedy and also a strength...

382
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Actually, there was a hidden mission during today's ethics class.

383
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,480
Find the lunch note! / Looks delicious!

384
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,000
During the debate, they had to find the hidden <lunch note> without the teacher or friends noticing!

385
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,480
I wonder what kind of substitute lunch will come out if they find the note?

386
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,520
Teacher: Since we've changed seats,

387
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,460
Teacher: how about we try to persuade each other?

388
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,520
SinB: Class president!

389
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,720
SinB: Go!

390
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,800
Umji: I think knowledge is power.

391
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,160
Umji: First, a person has to face the truth

392
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,340
Umji: to properly deal with reality

393
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,300
Umji: without misunderstandings...

394
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,000
Eunha: Keep going?

395
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,080
Umji: OK.

396
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,580
SinB: Hey, keep going.

397
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,800
Umji: Thinking of keep going,

398
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,180
Umji: one might think 'Ignorance is a remedy' but / Hwang Eunbi is more focused on

399
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,520
Umji: that's a bit... / openly looking for notes...

400
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,140
Umji: how should I put it?

401
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,840
Umji: It's a kind of avoidance... / Yewon enthusiastically debates for Eunbi

402
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,280
SinB: I thought so too. / enthusiastically agreeing

403
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,220
Umji: Right?

404
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,720
Umji: What do you guys think?

405
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,980
Eunha: If you don't know...

406
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,100
Eunha: you don't know that you don't know, right?

407
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,660
Eunha: If you don't know, you won't know that you don't know.

408
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,240
Eunha: And actually, I'm more focused not on knowing or not knowing

409
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,360
Eunha: but on power and medicine.

410
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,500
Eunha: but I've focused on 'power' and 'medicine'.

411
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,600
Umji: Oh, that's different...

412
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,940
Eunha: I focused on 'power' and 'medicine',

413
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,280
Eunha: What good is power anyway?

414
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,240
Eunha: It only leads to fighting.

415
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,020
Eunha: But medicine heals people,

416
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,780
Eunha: wraps them in love,

417
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,180
Eunha: that's why I think medicine is more important,

418
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,420
Eunha: and medicine triumphs over power.

419
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,260
SinB: But I...

420
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:08,900
SinB: Whatever it is, if you don't know, you can't defend yourself when attacked,

421
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,540
SinB: so if you stay ignorant, you'll just keep being attacked.

422
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,700
SinB: You need to know at least a bit to defend yourself.

423
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,680
SinB: Would you rather remain ignorant and be attacked,

424
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,380
SinB: or be informed and defend yourself?

425
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,580
SinB: Try to rebuttal that.

426
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,820
Eunha: Well...

427
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,280
Eunha: there are also uncomfortable truths

428
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,420
Eunha: that you wish you didn't know.

429
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,120
Umji: Too many of them.

430
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,720
Umji: The world is full of Pandora's boxes.

431
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,920
Eunha: Once you're aware of them, they keep bothering you,

432
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,000
Eunha: like if you keep thinking about swallowing

433
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,260
Eunha: and become conscious of every time you swallow,

434
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,060
Eunha: from that moment...

435
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,660
SinB: Ah!

436
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,260
SinB: Why did you mention that?!

437
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,760
A perfect example causing distress

438
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,160
Eunha: See? It happens like that.

439
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,380
An endless debate! What will the outcome be?

440
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,380
SinB: What are you even talking about now?

441
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,080
SinB: You're talking about 'Ignorance is bliss.'

442
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,580
Eunha: I want to stay ignorant.

443
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,380
Umji: Great singer.
