1
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,880
Hello, everyone

2
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:25,240
YING HA. YING HA.

3
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,280


4
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:35,840
I did a musical during the day and turned on the live broadcast

5
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:43,520
Today is a very special day for me and Lovelinus

6
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,800
Today is LOVELYZ's 9th anniversary

7
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,480
9 years! It's already been 9 years since Lovelyz

8
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,260
chan oppa, we will rock you go ahead

9
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,260
Let 'we will rock' have a nightlife! (you hung = nightlife)

10
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:14,760
It's our 9th anniversary, so we turned on this live broadcast

11
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:25,820
I put on makeup, and it's been hours, so my makeup has collapsed a lot, but please understand.

12
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,260
Please understand.

13
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,260
Please understand.

14
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,500
I'm not hungry, but why is my stomach rumbling?

15
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:39,260
So today, I'm going to celebrate my birthday in a self-congratulatory style.

16
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:55,260
They gave it to me in front of the musical.

17
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,260
It's...

18
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,260
They gave me this glass.

19
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,260
They gave me this glass.

20
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,260
They gave me this glass.

21
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:09,260
I can't alcohol right now, so I'll pour the drink.

22
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,200
It's not alcohol.
   
23
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,260
It's a drink.
  
24
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,260
Congratulations on your 9th anniversary.

25
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,260
Congratulations on your 9th anniversary.

26
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,260
Congratulations on your 9th anniversary.

27
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,260
Congratulations on your 9th anniversary.

28
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,260
Congratulations on your 9th anniversary.

29
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,260


30
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,260


31
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,260


32
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,260


33
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,260


34
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,260


35
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,260


36
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,260


37
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,260


38
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,260
It's delicious

39
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,260


40
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,260


41
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,260


42
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,260


43
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,260


44
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,260


45
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,260


46
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,260


47
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,260
It's delicious 

48
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,260


49
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,260


50
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,260


51
00:02:50,260 --> 00:03:00,260
Even if I drink a glass like this, will it feel like I'm drinking champagne?

52
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,260
It's not doping for Bae_ten.

53
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,260
Did you enjoy "Hibjiro Office Worker"? Thank you. 

54
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,260
I saw it at the end, too.

55
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,260
I'm back in the world of idols.

56
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,260
There were two endings.

57
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,260
So one is Ye-In who is going back to her life as an idol

58
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,260
"Ye-In who stays at work." There were two versions

59
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,260
Ye-In's version that's left at work was also filmed.

60
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:46,260
I filmed the ending with Jungwoo going home.

61
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:57,260


62
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,260
Yes, anyway

63
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,260
Won't they upload the leftover cookies?

64
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,260
Yeah, it would be nice if you could post it as a cookie.

65
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,260
There was originally an ending to work.

66
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:22,260
Time flies so fast. 9 years is like that

67
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:34,640
It's been 9 years since I've been with Lovelyz in my teens and 20s

68
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,400
It's so creepy. I feel like I'm a grandmother all of a sudden

69
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:52,860
Whenever I go somewhere these days, people tell me that they're enjoying Bae_ten's performance

70
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,420
Why do I feel so embarrassed whenever I hear that I'm watching Bae_ten well

71
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:04,020
I've shown you a lot of bad things in Bae_ten

72
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,140
I guess I'm a bit embarrassed thinking that you saw it

73
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,380
The light is so

74
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,000
Be dazzling.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,760
If I turn it off, it'll be too dark

76
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,320
In that case

77
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,980
At times like this 

78
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,820


79
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,320
What should I do?

80
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,100
Should I turn that on?

81
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:57,100


82
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,960


83
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,280
What about this, everyone

84
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,920


85
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,240


86
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,640
I think it's like this

87
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,380
I think this is better

88
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:27,180
What do you think

89
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,000
Nina, do you still like hearing the youngest sound

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,120
By all means.

91
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:38,300
I feel like I'm young. I'm happy because I feel that way

92
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,300
It sounds good.

93
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,860
I want you to come to Japan

94
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,640
I recently went to Japan

95
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,760
I went there because I had to do this and that

96
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,060
The weather is so nice

97
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,080
I'm so happy

98
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,100
I'm so happy

99
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,840
It was so nice

100
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,780
There might be new people coming in right now

101
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,280
This is not alcohol

102
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,560
It's a drink

103
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,360
It's not pear juice

104
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,260
It's a Sanpele Grino drink

105
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,580
Is the taxi fare real

106
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,520
I know. I missed the shuttle bus

107
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,720
It was about 260,000 won for a taxi

108
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,420
It was really sad

109
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:52,280
I didn't ride it for an hour or even an hour. I didn't ride a taxi for an hour

110
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:57,980
The taxi fare got hit by a bomb

111
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,900
I was so sad

112
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,960
I'll take the shuttle bus

113
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,960
What's that

114
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,240
Yeah, just buy the hoodie you want to buy

115
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,740
It's 260,000 won, so I'll pay for the taxi

116
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,140
I went to the airport with tears in my eyes

117
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,840
I went to the airport again

118
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,380
Narita Airport opens at 8 o'clock

119
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:32,060
So I couldn't find the store that opened, so I ate Shin Ramen at the convenience store

120
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,060
a true story

121
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:51,120
Anyway, I went to do that musical today

122
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,060
Many fans congratulated me on my 9th anniversary

123
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,560
I was so happy

124
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,180
I'm feeling cheerful.

125
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,040
Oh, the 9th anniversary

126
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,420
Congratulations on your 9th anniversary

127
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,680
Thank you, oppa

128
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,880
It's been a while since I talked to the older members

129
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,880
That's what happened

130
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:30,700
I didn't get in touch with the members that I didn't get in touch with often

131
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,060
in celebration of each other

132
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,420
I contacted him

133
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,620
That's right. Hun Sua came to watch the musical today, too

134
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,300
It felt so good to see Mamiruda for the first time in a while

135
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,500
She grew up a lot

136
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,020
Ye-In is in a good mood today. That's right

137
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,920
I feel good

138
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:00,420
Right, I think there were as many fans as the first song

139
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:01,900


140
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:01,940


141
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,040


142
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,060
You like me since 4 years of elementary school, and now you are in 3nd grade of high school?

143
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:10,700
Wow, you'll become an adult soon

144
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:17,100
I was so excited when I became an adult

145
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,100
but, it's not much different when you're an adult, is it?

146
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,940
but, it's not much different when you're an adult, is it?

147
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:31,940
but, it's not much different when you're an adult, is it?

148
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:37,900
but, it's not much different when you're an adult, is it?

149
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,900
Ye-In, I went to the Cheongeun Literature Library yesterday. It's really nice. That's right

150
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:45,780
Ye-In, I went to the Cheongeun Literature Library yesterday. It's really nice. That's right

151
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:50,540
I feel like I can read books that I've never read before

152
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,900
I remember watching Lovelyz on "Weekly Idol"

153
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,940
I remember watching Lovelyz on "Weekly Idol"

154
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,300
Isn't Mi-Joo the MC for "Weekly Idol"?

155
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,860
I'm so proud of you

156
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,800
I'm so proud of you

157
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,560
I don't play LoL

158
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,760
I'm not good at games

159
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,080
I don't know how to play games

160
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,400
I'm not good at games.

161
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,740
You're going to watch it next week?

162
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,280
Yes, come and watch it

163
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,860
It's fun. Musical

164
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,680
I didn't feel good when I became an adult

165
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,540
failed the SAT.
 
166
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,160
It's okay. The test can fail.

167
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,440
Our lives are not ruined

168
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,760
Is it possible for Yang Yein right now...

169
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,760
What's Yang Ye-in?

170
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,780
What is Yang Ye-in?

171
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,560
Do you eat a lot?

172
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,660
Okay, eat a lot

173
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,260
pigtails

174
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,880
Since I did pigtails in the musical

175
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,180
Rather than pigtails

176
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:25,080
I like hair with dumplings on both sides

177
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,080
You don't know how comfortable this hair is, do you?

178
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,780
If you do this, it's really comfortable

179
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,660
It's not annoying

180
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,680


181
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,340
It's gotten really cold these days, right

182
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,440
I remember we debuted when it was this cold

183
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,920
As far as I remember, we had a showcase at YES24

184
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,260
I went to see the fan concert yesterday?

185
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,260
I went to see the fan concert yesterday?

186
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,060
I went to see the fan concert yesterday?

187
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:08,840
A teacher who plays the role of Galileo

188
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,060
They had a fan concert

189
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,380
I went to YES24 again

190
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,400
It reminded me of the past

191
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,200
I was like this, but what if I didn't do it at YES24?

192
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,160
Was it at Blue Square?

193
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,060
I think I did it at YES24. Anyway

194
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,060
Oh? You had your debut showcase at Olympic Park?

195
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,060


196
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,060


197
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,060


198
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,060


199
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:38,740


200
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:39,000
Where did we have our debut showcase, Lovelyz?

201
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,740
I think it was YES24?

202
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:50,820


203
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,360
Don't you remember because it's been so long?

204
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,060
Anyway

205
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,060
It's very

206
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:07,440
It reminded me of this. I recently watched some Lovelyz diaries.

207
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:18,540
I saw it, and I think that fresh feeling disappears only when it's not that time.

208
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:25,880
I'm so thankful that it was recorded then.

209
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,880
I'm at home right now, everyone.

210
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:44,060
We're getting old together, really. We're getting old together.

211
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,880
Season's greeting concept spoiler?

212
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,880
It's not fun to give spoilers.

213
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:04,880
I went to the shop. I had a musical during the day.

214
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,880
Lovelyz in Wonderland. Lovelyz in Wonderland was fun too.

215
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,880
Now that I think about it, the fact that we filmed a reality program with our names on it

216
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:30,880
I think it was a great and thankful thing.

217
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:37,880
I had a lot of fun filming it. I'm still in touch with the producers I worked with

218
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:44,880
I had a lot of fun filming it.

219
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,880
Canada that LOVELYZ loved?

220
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:53,880
That was really nice in Canada.

221
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,880


222
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,880


223
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,880
It was so nice, Canada.

224
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,880
Of course, the members talked about our 9th anniversary.

225
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,880
Of course I did.

226
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,880


227
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,880


228
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,880


229
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,880


230
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,880
As soon as the comments said Ye-In has good physical strength

231
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,760
I'm yawning so tired just now.

232
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:44,880
I think my physical strength has gotten a lot worse.

233
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,300


234
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,120


235
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,880
For the past 9 years

236
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,880
For the past 9 years

237
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,880
Thank you for being by my side

238
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,880
Thank you for being by my side

239
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,380
Thank you so much, Linus

240
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,820
I'll be a Linus for the rest of my life

241
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,880
I'll be LOVELYZ forever

242
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,880
Have you eaten your dinner?

243
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,500
No, not yet

244
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,880
I'm hungry

245
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,280
I'm hungry

246
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:27,380
I don't think I'm used to the daytime performances yet

247
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,720
I can't wake up

248
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,960
Anyway, it's our 9th anniversary

249
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,260
9th anniversary

250
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:45,280
9th anniversary

251
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:51,580
Let's say congratulations again

252
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:55,760
Oh, yes. The sound right now is the sound of the washing machine

253
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,280
I'm running the washing machine right now

254
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,160
In a little while

255
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,840
But since I just turned it on

256
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,260
Speaking of dinner, Do you remember eating salad during the live broadcast?

257
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,060
Ramen is so

258
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,320
I ate a small ramen for a long time

259
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,980
Who's going to refill the ramen from the bottom?

260
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,260
I ate a small ramen for a long time

261
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:45,760
I ate a small ramen for a long time

262
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,260
I ate a small ramen for a long time

263
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,960
I ate a small ramen for too long

264
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,040
I'm still slow to eat

265
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,200
But I've been eating a lot lately

266
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,840
When I was in a musical

267
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,820
I gained a lot of weight while watching how I lost weight

268
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:07,220
I think I gained about 1 or 2kg

269
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,420
I don't have a scale at home

270
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,560
I don't know exactly how much I weigh

271
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,240
I don't know exactly how much I weigh

272
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,480
I think I lost 1 or 2kg

273
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,120
I think I lost 1 or 2kg

274
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,500
I think I gained weight

275
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,820


276
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:29,760


277
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:39,320
Wow, but

278
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,240


279
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,620


280
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,640


281
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,000


282
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,940
If your eye body is okay, it's okay

283
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,760
I think the eye body is more important

284
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,100
When I measure my body

285
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,100
I don't really like it

286
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,240
I don't feel good

287
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,820
When I measure my in-body

288
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,740
Don't you feel bad

289
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:43,620


290
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:43,660


291
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:43,680


292
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:43,700

293
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:43,720


294
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:43,740


295
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,440
My eye body feels bad, too

296
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,440
It's so funny

297
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:58,440
I don't think I'm that close to working out

298
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,440
I do it when I do, but I don't think I like it

299
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:11,440
Thank you. Happy 9th anniversary, RINUS

300
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:24,740
Yes, the glasses don't have any lenses. These are fashion glasses

301
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,740
It's our 9th anniversary

302
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,740
But it's such a shame not to do live, right?

303
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,740
Do I look younger with glasses?

304
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,740
Do I look smart?

305
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,740
What's the thing that makes you look smart?

306
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,740
Do I look like a smart kid?

307
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:20,740
Can you be friends with someone born in 2009? Of course, I can

308
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,740
I don't have anything like that

309
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:31,740
I'm consoling you because I'm like friends with you

310
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:42,740
It doesn't matter if the younger members treat you like that

311
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,740


312
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:56,740
Does it feel different when you wear glasses? Are your eyes half closed?

313
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:04,740


314
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,740
Okay, let's be friends. Let's be friends

315
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,740
Okay, let's be friends. Let's be friends

316
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,740
Okay, let's be friends. Let's be friends

317
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,740
You can just call me "unni oppa"

318
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:20,740
You have to relax your mind and do that

319
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:24,740
You think I can fly around in the Kkotto Show with these glasses?

320
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,740
Do you call your brother or uncle who is 15 years older than you?

321
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,740
brother 

322
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,740
HYOIN is here, too

323
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,740
I don't know if they came in or if they pressed the wrong button

324
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:46,740
Anyways, everyone

325
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,740
I'm very hungry

326
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,740
I was a bit sleepy

327
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:04,740
Should I just sleep without eating? Should I eat or not? What would be good?

328
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,740


329
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,740


330
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,740


331
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,740
Do you think it would be embarrassing to do a live broadcast in front of your family?

332
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,740
No, I'm not embarrassed at all

333
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,740
I'm not embarrassed at all

334
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,740
I'm thinking that there's only Lovelinus here

335
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,740
It's carbonated

336
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,740
I don't fill up the amount

337
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,740
There's ji youn

338
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,740
Congratulations on your 9th anniversary

339
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,740
Is the purple pajama from the picture you posted today?

340
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,740
I'm still wearing pants. Purple pajamas

341
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:06,740
This is a pajama brand called Prinkly Sleepy

342
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,740
My YouTube...

343
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,740
If you go to Ye-In's YouTube channel, I've explained everything

344
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,740
Let me tell you again what it tastes like

345
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,740
It's not alcohol

346
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,740
Just.

347
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,740
It's a drink

348
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:50,740


349
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,740
What's wrong with my hair?

350
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,740
I woke up this morning and the weather was so cold

351
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:18,240
So I thought, "What would I have done if I didn't have a robe at home?"

352
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:28,120
I went to the musical with the heating on. I came home and it was so warm and I felt really good

353
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:38,120
I didn't go on a trip to Japan, but I couldn't film YouTube

354
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:47,600
But the weather was so cold yesterday. I thought I was going to freeze to death on the street

355
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:08,460
Colds and flu are in vogue these days. Even if you're lazy, make sure to wear a mask

356
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:08,480


357
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:08,680


358
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:08,720


359
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:08,740


360
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,740
It's sad when you're sick

361
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,860
Anyways, everyone

362
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,860
Congratulations on your 9th anniversary

363
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,580
Congratulations to me, too

364
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,060
Congratulations to all of us

365
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,660
Congratulations

366
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,400
Congratulations to all of us

367
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,720
I'll do a live broadcast again soon

368
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:02,820
Whenever I say "everyone", I feel like I'm going to end the live broadcast

369
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,220
I can turn it on again. Next time

370
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,180
Next time, after the musical

371
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:12,460
I'm going to wear a live broadcast

372
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:16,020
As soon as I turned off the live broadcast

373
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:21,020
I feel like I can fall asleep in a minute

374
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,980
It's sad to go on our 9th anniversary

375
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,580
I'll stay awake a little longer

376
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:47,020
Congratulations on your 9th anniversary

377
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:50,740
Thanks to RINUS, I was able to do this much

378
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,360
Thank you for your support

379
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:57,860
Hi.

380
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,160
Bye, everyone. See you again

381
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,580
Hi.

382
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:08,280
Su-Jeong does capture time. Should I try it too

383
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,860
Take a screenshot of me, too

384
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,160
9th anniversary

385
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,060
Bye Bye

386
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,680


387
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,400
Bye Bye

388
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,460
Bye Bye

389
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,780


390
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:42,780
