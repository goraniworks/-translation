00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,440
Are you all enjoying the holiday?

3
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:31,800
Hello, where am I? I'm on my way to the radio station.

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,180
So, I decided to do a live broadcast after a long time.

5
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:43,360
I was wondering if our Lovelinus are resting well during the holiday? Are you ready for the radio show?

6
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,960
I turned on the live because it's been such a long time and I feel sorry about it.

7
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,900
I've kept it on.

8
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,860
You're all doing well, right?

9
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,420
Let's do this.

10
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,880
Right now, Brother Seongjae is in Qatar, so

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,160
I'm acting as the special DJ for the radio this week.

12
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,000
We have a live broadcast at 10 PM tonight.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,520
Where can you watch it?

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,680
EraoTV?

15
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,280
Anyway, something on the internet.

16
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,600
You can find out how to watch it by searching online, right?

17
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,480
Ah, you can watch it there too.

18
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,420
If you search "Bae Seongjae" on KakaoTV, you'll probably find it.

19
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,520
Anyway, since it's a radio you can see,

20
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,420
if you have time, please watch the radio show as well.

21
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:48,500
It's been a while since I've done a live,

22
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,420
seeing our Insta-friends after such a long time

23
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,120
is really nice.

24
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:01,280
Have you all gone back to your hometowns (where your family lives) for Seollal?

25
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,260
Lip? Uh, I'm not sure what that is.

26
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,420
I'm not sure what lip is, sorry.

27
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,700
I'm not sure about the lip.

28
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,680
Dinner is a banana.

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Because last night,

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,120
I ate too much. I ate too much for dinner.

31
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,280
So today, I'm going to make do with a banana.

32
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,280
"Unnie, you're going to have a fan meeting this year too, right?"

33
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,280
I really want to do it too,

34
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,000
so I'll try to make it happen.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,280
I can't promise, I'll do my best.

36
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,280
Hold on, I'll peel a banana.

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,280
But I thought it had warmed up a bit, but it's still a bit cold today.

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,280
Peeling a banana.

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,280
Eating a banana like this

40
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,280
and drinking milk,

41
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,280
makes it banana milk.

42
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,280
"Finishing the day happily after seeing the live broadcast after work."

43
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,280
Thank you, Haruka.

44
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,280
It's been a while since we had milk.

45
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,280
It tastes even better than I remembered, doesn't it?

46
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,280
When I was young, I used to drink plain milk reluctantly.

47
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,280
As I grew up,

48
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,280
it seems my taste has changed.

49
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
There was plain milk for school meals when I was young, right?

50
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,280
When I was young, I drank it reluctantly and used to mix it with all sorts of things like chocolate powder

51
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,000
but nowadays, I drink plain milk just fine.

52
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
Everyone,

53
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,280
have you gone to your hometown?

54
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,280
"I really enjoy watching ELLE Dong videos(yein insta)."

55
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,280
Thank you.

56
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,280
I also enjoy watching my ELLE Dong videos.

57
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,280
"I can't go to my hometown, so I'll sleep watching the radio show."

58
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,280
Good idea.
 
59
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,280
"I saw the WABAR video(YouTube) earlier", thank you.

60
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,280
I happened to connect with Brother Wadi like this,

61
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,280
so we filmed together.

62
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,280
It was really fun.

63
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,280
I'm not going to my hometown.

64
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,280
I'm not going to my hometown,

65
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,280
because I have things to do in Seoul.

66
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,280
So, I think I'll be in Seoul.

67
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,280
But really, eating just one banana and milk together gives a lot of satiety.

68
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,280
It feels very filling.

69
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,280
My stomach is too full.

70
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,280
My stomach is really full.

70
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,200
"Is one banana enough? Have two."

71
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,280
The one I just ate is the second one.

72
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,280
I ate one at home earlier,

73
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,280
and I thought I might get hungry again,

74
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,280
so I ate another one in the car.

75
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,280
Ah, Doco, I always forget my hat.

76
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,280
Could you please take care of it for me?

77
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,280
I always leave something behind.

78
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,280
Anyway, that's how it is.

79
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,280
Please watch, everyone. Today is the last day.

80
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,280
But the things we've pre-recorded will go out on the radio on Saturday and Sunday,

81
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,280
and they're already up on YouTube,

82
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,280
so everything that's been prepared will be available.

83
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,280
Today is already the last day, but the radio has been

84
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,280
so much fun.

85
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,280
What should I do over the holiday, everyone?

86
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,280
What are your plans for the holiday?

87
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,280
Have you all gone to your hometown?

88
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,660
Drinking milk with red vinegar, I know what that is.

89
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,820
It becomes somewhat like yogurt, right?

90
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,400
What's on sale at Costco these days for 120,000 won?

91
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,820
But I've arrived at the radio, everyone.

92
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,980
"Why can't you go to your hometown?"

93
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,260
During the holiday, it's whiskey.

94
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:25,760
Right, whiskey is good, but after finishing work during the holiday,

95
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,180
I feel like drinking wine.

96
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,020
Before coming to the radio show,

97
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,680
I bought three bottles of wine from a local wine shop.

98
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,000
Two bottles of white wine,

99
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,580
and one bottle of red wine.

100
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:50,080
One of the white wines is a recent favorite of mine,

101
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,820
and the other is said to be very similar to

102
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:01,380
that wine but a few ten-thousands of won cheaper.

103
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,540
So, I was curious about that and bought a bottle of it too.

104
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,000
And I really like Caymus wine,

105
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,520
but if you buy it in Korea, it's currently selling for about 140,000 won.

106
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,460
But a bottle for 140,000 won isn't exactly cheap, right?

107
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:24,000
There are more expensive wines, of course,

108
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
but I got some recommendations for wines similar to Caymus,

109
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:36,780
thinking about trying a different feel among American wines,

110
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,660
Because Caymus is an American wine.

111
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,500
So, other American wines...

112
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,740
Ah! No, no, no.

113
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,500
French wine... No?

114
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,020
Where was it?

115
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,380
Where was it? Gayoung?

116
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,780
Ah, where was it? Some...

117
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,980
That wine is really famous in France,

118
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,340
the only one to win 1st place in a blind test.

119
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,180
Which country was it from?

120
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:04,620
Anyway, that's what they say, so

121
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,060
that...

122
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,780
Not Caymus,

123
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:13,700
I also bought another red wine I'm trying for the first time.

124
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,780
But Caymus is a bit sweet,

125
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,540
it doesn't show up as having a lot of sugar content when you look it up, but

126
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,940
it tastes sweet to me.

127
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,820
But it's somewhat sweet and

128
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,940
as rich as Caymus,

129
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,000
they said there's another wine like that,

130
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,580
so I bought a bottle to try it.

131
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,000
That's why I bought three bottles,

132
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,900
and it came out to just over 100,000 won.

133
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,380
Was it 140,000 won?

134
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,900
One bottle of Caymus is 140,000 won,

135
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,000
but today, in thrifty shopping, I got three bottles for 140,000 won.

136
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,620
Gotcha!

137
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,900
Ah, this filter keeps applying to my hand...

138
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,860
This thing turning red is pretty funny

139
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,500
I put on a filter today because

140
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,020
my skin is a bit troubled right now,

141
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,340
I first turned it on with the normal quality...

142
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,180
I tried like this,

143
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,420
but things like this on my forehead, like my skin troubles, are too visible,

144
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:23,780
so today I thought I needed to smooth things over a bit,

145
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,140
That's it. It's been a while since I put on a filter...

146
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,020
Anyway, I've arrived, so I have to go, everyone.

147
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,300
If you want to see me again, please move to the radio show.

148
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,580
It starts at 10 PM.

149
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,000
Everyone,

150
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Goodbye, see you again.

151
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,000
Bye.
