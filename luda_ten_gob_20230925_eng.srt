Taekwondo Poomsae, Modern Pentathlon, Fencing, Swimming, Judo, etc.

Regardless of the color of the medal, for those who have run for the Asian Games,

26
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,320
Thank you very much to the Korean national team.

27
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,320
Even if you didn't win a medal, thank you to all the athletes who have done their best

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,320
As national representatives and are still running in the games.

29
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,320
I can't watch every game, but I'm cheering from afar,

30
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,320
Fighting, Team Korea.

31
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,320
Fighting to the broadcast team, including DJ Bae Sung-jae, who is delivering news about our athletes,

32
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,320
And to the broadcast team.

33
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,320
Please take care of Hangzhou, I'll take care of here.

34
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,320
I’m not sure if I should read this on air today, 

35
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,320
But this is the script,

36
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,320
With Jung Yong-guk, a gagman who is living a wrong life,

37
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,320
We will be doing the counseling corner, 'Go All Out Spicy Counseling Center'.

38
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,320
Instead of comfort and warm advice, harsh words, disses, and

39
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,320
Realistic counseling is what they say.

40
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,320
I wonder if it will go well with my cynical self, or not.

41
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,320
We'll check in the corner later.

42
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,320
If you want to receive realistic and direct counseling from Mr. Jung Yong-guk,

43
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:37,320
Please send your concerns via short text for 50 won, long text for 100 won to #1077.

44
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,320
If you want to listen while watching the live broadcast,

45
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,320
You can see Gorilla...

00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,320
You can enter through Gorilla's Visible Radio or Kakao TV

47
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,320
By searching for Bae Sung-jae.

48
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,320
YouTube... Uh, sorry.

49
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,320
It is also broadcast live on the YouTube Erao channel.

50
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,320
Before the main corner, there is a text introduction corner

51
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,320
Called Freestyle Confessions.

52
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,320
If you want to talk to me, Luda,

53
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,320
Please feel free to send daily texts.

54
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,320
Yes. If you send any message freely, I will introduce it in

55
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,320
The text introduction corner, Freestyle Confessions.

56
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,320
'Now More Warring' sent this.

57
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,320
'Who is Bae Sung-jae?'

58
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,320
You sent this, but uh, wait a minute.

59
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,320
I'll be back after listening to the ads. Freestyle Confessions.

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,320
Any comments you send will be introduced in the text introduction corner, Freestyle Confessions.

61
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,000
I just saw a comment.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Subin, who was here last time, also skipped the ads like I did.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,320
I apologize to the advertisers.

64
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,320
Yes, 4210 sent this.

65
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,320
"Luda, is this your first time as a radio DJ?"

66
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,320
"I'm curious about your feelings about being the first radio DJ on Baeten."

67
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,000
Actually, it's my first time as a DJ, so I'm very nervous.

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I look forward to your kind cooperation, Baeten listeners.

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:14,000
"Bae Sung-jae, don't come" sent "WJSN Subin was the first substitute DJ on Baeten. Did you get any tips?"

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
"like 'Be careful with the Monday guest.' " 

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Actually, I contacted her right after she went to Baeten.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,320
When I asked how it was, she said, "It was very draining."

73
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,320
But is that the Monday guest?

74
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,320
I'm not sure.

75
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:45,320
5878 sent "I went to the mart on the weekend and people were busy preparing for the holiday. It was a weekend that was excited by the busy and busy atmosphere unique to the holiday."

76
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,320
And 'Park In-gyu' sent "Ludi looks relaxed. Keke."

77
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,320
"Think back to the time when you mercilessly advised listeners during the ‘Pathetic’ segment and just relax."

78
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,320
"There's PD Panghyun who will wear a suit and apologize to the Broadcasting Commission."

79
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,320
Do I look relaxed?

80
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm a robot.

81
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:14,000
7938 sent "I came to pick up my daughter who is going to take her first test from tomorrow after becoming a middle school student, and I heard Luda's voice."

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,320
"It's cute that you're a little clumsy and stuttering. Laugh laugh."

83
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,320
"I'm listening while laughing in the car on a rainy day."

84
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,320
I don't stutter much.

85
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,320
Yes, that was Luda's Freestyle Confessions.

86
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:36,000
We will listen to your concerns, but please bear with the emotional wounds that you may experience during the consultation.

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,320
A very spicy counseling center where harsh words and witty remarks fly back and forth. 'Jung Yong-guk's 'Go All Out Spicy Counseling Center'.

88
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,320
A strange man who gets a question bombing every time a special DJ comes.

89
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,320
Welcome, unheard-of comedian Jung Yong-guk.

90
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,320
Nice to meet you. I'm the unheard-of comedian, Jung Yong-guk.

91
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,000
We've met before, right?

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,320
Really?

93
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,000
Yes. Don't you remember?

94
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,320
Where did we meet?

95
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:05,320
Earlier, before the broadcast, you asked 'Have you been here before?', haven't we seen each other here? When appearing on 'Beten'?

96
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,000
During Baeten?

97
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,320
Yes

98
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,320
I didn't see you.

99
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,000
Really?

100
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,320
Yes.

101
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,320
You said you would give me tripe then.

102
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
Me?

103
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:17,320
Yes. I don't remember well, but I remember the tripe because you said you would give me a good deal on tripe.

104
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
There's no one but me for tripe.

105
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,320
Yes, you didn't give me tripe. But.

106
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
Didn't you come?

107
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
Yes, I didn't go.

108
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,320
What's that?

109
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,320
I didn't go, but I didn't see you.

110
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,320
Yes, that's it.

111
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,320
Yes.

112
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Ah, we met.

113
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,320
Yes, we've met. Right, everyone? Yes, we've met.

114
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,320
I see. I didn't know. As people age, their memory tends to decline.


115
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,320
That can happen.

116
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,320
Can it happen?

117
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,320
Yes, I totally understand.

118
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
Yes, thank you.

119
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:51,320
Every time special DJs come, they say that a barrage of questions is unleashed on Mr. Jung Yong-guk. 

120
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,320
What kind of questions do you get?

121
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,320
What do you do? How did you get here? Something like that.

122
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,320
How did you get in? Like that.

123
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:06,320
Yes, Subin was like that last time. Yes, to me. Who is this person? What is this? Kind of like that.

124
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,320
At that time, I said I had been doing it for 7 years. "Eh? You’ve been doing it for that long?" So I heard a lot of strange stories.

125
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,320
Then, how do I look to you?

126
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
Aren't you a girl group?

127
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,320
Really? Oh, thank you.

128
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,320
But you look really pale in person.

129
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,320
There's a lot of lighting here.

130
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,320
Don't I have lighting? I should have lighting too, right?

131
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,320
It seems like there's no lighting there.

132
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,320
Do you look at people without saying anything?

133
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,320
It seems like the lighting doesn't go well there.

134
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,320
Your face is really small.

135
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,320
Oh, thank you.

136
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,320
You're really pretty.

137
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,320
Oh, thank you.

138
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,320
'I would remember you if I saw you, so why can't I remember?

139
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,320
I'm upset. A little. My heart hurts.

140
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,320
'Don't speak so confidently when you don't even come to our store

141
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,320
Yes, I understand.

142
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,320
Yes.

143
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:59,320
Eun Jung Hoon sent 'I expected it, but it's really awkward. Kekekeke' Are we not awkward? Aren't we okay?

144
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,000
This person is just talking.

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,320
Oh, really?

146
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,320
Yes, you don't have to worry at all.

147
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,320
We're not awkward.

148
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,320
Yes, you don't have to worry at all.

149
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,320
Yes, it's the Asian Games season now.

150
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,320
Are you watching any games?

151
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,320
I saw earlier in the elevator that DJ Bae Sung-jae is currently broadcasting swimming

152
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,320
Yes, that's right.

153
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
Yes, I watch it sometimes.

154
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,320
Sometimes.

155
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,320
Yes, I watch soccer.

156
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
Soccer.

157
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,320
Yes, because Bae Di is broadcasting again.

158
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,320
Korea is a soccer nation after all. Probably. Koreans really like soccer.

159
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,000
Is that so?

160
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,320
Yes, that's right.

161
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,320
Yes, there's a story for Jung Yong Guk.

162
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,320
Yes, tell me.

163
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,320
Ha Jungsuk sent 'I'm looking forward to the combination of cynical Luda and Jung Yong Guk.'

164
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,320
I can't figure out the character right now.

165
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,320
My character analysis?

166
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,320
Yes.

167
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,320
Hehe.

168
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,320
Yes, I have no idea at all.

169
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,320
Hehe.

170
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,320
In the middle of the conversation.

171
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:54,320
I think I need to understand your personality to figure out what kind of talk I can have with you.

172
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:01,320
'5990' sent 'What is Luda's worry?' How about counseling Jung Yong Guk before the tasting?'

173
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,320
Do you have any worries? No, right?

174
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,320
I do have one big worry in my life.

175
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,320
That sigh was real.

176
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
Yes, what is it?

177
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,320
I want to cut my hair.

178
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,000
I don't know much about hair.

179
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,320
!!!!!!!!!

180
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
Do you react like that?

181
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,320
Hair

182
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
That's the only thing I don't know.

183
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,320
Hair

184
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,320
I don't know about hair.

185
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,320
Oh, then let's move on.

186
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,000
Then.

187
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What is this?

188
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,320
This is enough for the preview talk.

189
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
I was surprised.

190
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,320
Let's go into the home corner.

191
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,320
'Go All Out Spicy Counseling Center' is receiving your concerns.

192
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:47,320
Please send your concerns to #1077, short text for 50 won, long text for 100 won, free for Gorilla or mobile messenger, or post your concerns on the Monday board.

193
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:53,320
For all the people introduced, what is the gift 'Sixpan exchange coupon'?

194
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,320
Sixpack.

195
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,320
We give you a 'Sixpack exchange coupon'.

196
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:04,000
Then, shall we start with the corner inside the corner that introduces the story of 1 day 1 year of the 'Go All Out Spicy Counseling Center'?

197
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Jung Yong-guk's Love Theory.

198
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,320
There's a man who confessed to me a year ago.

199
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,320
I refused and we're getting along well as colleagues.

200
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,320
A female employee who joined the company recently asked me to push that man well.

201
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,320
It's a bit uncomfortable situation, isn't it?

202
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,320
Should I pretend not to know and let it go? Or should I just create an opportunity for them to be together?"

203
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,320
This is the story of a woman from 8024.

204
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:39,320
There's a man who confessed a year ago, and she refused, and a female employee who joined the company recently asked me to help him do well.

205
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,320
This is the story, but I've done a lot anyway.

206
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,320
Confession?

207
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
The story.

208
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,000
Oh, surprise.

209
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,320
I'm old doesn't mean I've done a lot.

210
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
I thought you were a pro confessor.

211
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So, how do you see it? Please tell me.

212
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,320
I don't think you'd be curious about my story.

213
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,320
Yeah

214
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
What should she do?

215
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,320
If it were me, I would just make a place once.

216
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,320
Is that so?

217
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,000
Yes.

218
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,320
This person confessed a year ago, and it seems a bit awkward for her, but does that matter?

219
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,320
I heard that the sender didn't confess, but refused.

220
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:29,320
By introducing another person like this, 'I have no interest in you at all and anyway, I was asked to help, so there's nothing that can't be done' I think I'll do it.

221
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:35,320
Oh, looking at your face, it seems like you've been rejected a lot.

222
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,320
It was a life of rejection.

223
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,320
Yes, I think I have a similar idea.

224
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
You don't have to worry at all.

225
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,320
Even if you make a place once, there won't be a big situation.

226
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,320
But the point here is, wasn't there a man who confessed a year ago?

227
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,320
Why did I tell you not to worry about this person? This person may not know that he confessed.

228
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,320
Hmm. Is it your experience?

229
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,320
Don't keep pushing that way.

230
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,320
No. A year is a very long time, right?

231
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,320
That's right.

232
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,320
There must be a lot of employees in the company, right?

233
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,320
Did he confess to only one woman?

234
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,320
Is it that bad? Suddenly?

235
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,320
It's not the worst. Honestly, it's not a good situation.

236
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,320
So now this woman may remember, but.

237
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,320
Since the man who failed to confess his love

238
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,320
so he could meet another girl, 

239
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,320
he could confess to another girl, 

240
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,320
You don't have to worry about that.

241
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,320
Oh, it's a bit uncomfortable, but you don't need to think about it at all.

242
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,320
That's right.

243
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:39,320
Then just tell the female employee who ‘asked you to make this opportunity’ to ‘wait a little bit’.

244
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Yes.

245
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,000
He's going to confess.

246
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,320
No, that's not it.

247
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,320
If you look at the food pyramid, it's like a character pyramid.

248
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,320
Now this story teller is at the top.

249
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,320
And now the man is in the middle.

250
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:57,320
The new employee who just came in hasn't been there for long, but she's already trying to date.

251
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,320
So, the company runs well with this structure, really.

252
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
They say they do something.

253
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,320
Isn't it that everything works out just because they introduce it?

254
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,000
That's right.

255
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,320
That's right.

256
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,320
People think it will go well in the future when they go on a blind date.

257
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,320
First of all, a blind date is just a place someone has prepared.

258
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
That's right.

259
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,320
Usually, the probability of failure is higher.

260
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
Rather than the probability of success.

261
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,320
That's right.

262
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
Of course.

263
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Isn't it?

264
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,320
Because you have a lot of experience.

265
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,000
What do you think I do for a living right now?

266
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,320
I don't know.

267
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,320
So, you can just do it.

268
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,000
Yes.

269
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,320
The bad thing is that even if the two of them do well, I don't think there will be an expression of gratitude.

270
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,320
I don't think she's looking for the expression of gratitude.

271
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:47,320
But if the person who sent the story is uncomfortable, it seems right not to do it.

272
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,320
Is that so? I don't think it will be uncomfortable.

273
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,320
I think so too.

274
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,320
Yes.

275
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,320
This person seems to have sent a concern because of that.

276
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,320
Yes.

277
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,320
Just do whatever you want.

278
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,320
That's right. That's right.

279
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,320
You do whatever you want.

280
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,320
And then it goes really well.

281
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,320
It's a bit annoying to see. Even if it's not jealousy.

282
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,320
Throw a word when it's going well later.

283
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,320
He's the one I rejected.

284
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,320
Why?

285
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,320
That's a bit.

286
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,320
No, it can be green with envy if it goes well.

287
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,320
Why are you upset about it?

288
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,320
Most people are like that.

289
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:28,320
Usually, when it goes well, they come to me and buy me a meal or a cup of coffee. If they just think they're doing well, you can throw it in the middle.

290
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
He confessed to me.

291
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
You're a scary person.

292
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
Are you not adapted to this culture?

293
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,000
Yes.

294
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,320
That's right. I haven't even started yet

295
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,320
While summarizing the story, let's hear a word of Jung Yong-guk's love guide.

296
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,000
Jung Yong-guk's Love Theory.

297
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:55,320
You don't need to worry at all. Men tend to forget their own confessions

298
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,320
Is that something to admire?

299
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
I don't understand.

300
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,000
That's right.

301
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,320
Yes.

302
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,320
Usually, when a man confesses, women often feel sorry when they refuse.

303
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,320
Yes.

304
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:11,320
There's no need to feel sorry because men already know they're going to be rejected and talk, so they don't have to feel sorry.

305
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
Do men confess knowing they might be rejected?

306
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,320
That's right. To some extent.

307
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,320
Wrong

308
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,320
Why?

309
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,000
Is it a strange story?

310
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,320
This is quite generalized.

311
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,000
Isn't it just Jung Yong-guk who thinks he will be rejected and confesses?

312
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,320
I'm the only one who gets rejected.

313
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,320
Isn't it?

314
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,320
Usually, they go with the probability of being rejected.

315
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,320
Do you go? I guess so.

316
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,320
Really.

317
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I can't figure out your character right now.

318
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's hard.

319
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Is it hard?

320
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,320
Yes.

321
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,000
Then let's go for a general story first.

322
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,320
Yes.

323
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,320
Story number one.

324
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,320
Why?

325
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,000
I have story number one.

326
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,320
Yes.

327
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,320
I don't have it.

328
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,320
General story.

329
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
General story.

330
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
Is there no next story?

331
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,320
Ah, here it is.

332
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,320
Yes.

333
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,320
I'm out of my mind right now.

334
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,320
I'm sorry.

335
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,000
Luda's Ten with special DJ Luda.

336
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,320
The door to the second part has opened.

337
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:11,560
We are doing a counseling corner 'Go All Out Spicy Counseling Center' with the wrong man, Jung Yong-guk.

338
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,000
Shall we meet your worries right away?

339
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:22,040
After deliberation, Mr. Jung Yong-guk gives a strong wake-up call to the person in distress, helping them regain their senses and solve their problems.

340
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,960
You can do it.

341
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,320
It's a story sent by a man named 'Kang Jun-seo'.

342
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:37,040
I don't like anything much, and even if I do, I easily get bored.

343
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,080
So I can't work for a long time.

344
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,180
But thinking about the people I work with, I endure it for about a year to a year and a half

345
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,560
I do work, but I have to earn money for a lifetime.

346
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,800
So I wonder if I can live like this, but if I get bored, I want to quit again.

347
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,560
Give me a wake-up call ㅠㅠ.

348
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,560
What do you think?

349
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,800
You keep staring at me.

350
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
No, how do you see the story?

351
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,800
The story?

352
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,000
You have to talk, don't you?

353
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I can just talk comfortably?

354
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,800
Live as you please.

355
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,560
If you don't want to do it, quit, if you want to do more, do it, you don't know if you'll die tomorrow

356
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,000
That's life, you have to live doing what you want. Right?

357
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,080
It seems like Pomnyun monk is here now. 'Just live as you want.'

358
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,080
I think so.

359
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,220
But now, Jun-seo, can you live like this?

360
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:36,440
Especially, he wants to work, but he hasn't felt much yet

361
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,340
It seems like he sent a story.

362
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,340
I think so.

363
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,460
Work for about a year to a year and a half and then quit.

364
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:48,460
Why do you think so? I think it's because of unemployment benefits.

365
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,460
Why are you sighing like this?

366
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,380
Ah, it's ding-dong-dang, ah, it's ding-dong-dang, this again

367
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,000
This makes sense.

368
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,220
Absolutely.

369
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,220
It makes sense.

370
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,220
Unemployment benefits make sense.

371
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,600
If you receive unemployment benefits and the money comes out, doesn't it come out 60% 70% then

372
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,840
Now, if you order a little less delivery food and eat it, if the money is a little less, then

373
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:14,220
Let's work again and then work again and then when the money runs out again, unemployment benefits again

374
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,340
And then go to another place for an interview and say, "I can't get social insurance?" then don't go.

375
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:23,020
You are at an age where you can do this now.

376
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:27,740
If you don't avoid hard and difficult tasks, your age, which allows you to receive requests, makes these tasks seem less significant. As you age... I'll stop here.

377
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,000
You are at an age where you can do more work.

378
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
This doesn't seem to matter now, but as you get older.

379
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I will do up to here.

380
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
For now, I will do up to here because of time and continue in the third part.

381
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,120
@We work and earn money for happiness or love, but life is not about taking a test and getting a conclusion.

382
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,920
@Let's not get confused about the absolute frequency, it's Bae Sung-jae's Ten, shortened to Baeten.

383
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,640
@Women are more interested in men's stories, they know how to talk about cars and dramas.

384
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,300
@A man's broadcast for men, so it's also for women's hearts

385
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:07,820
@Do something, brother, everyone, it's the first broadcast for men

386
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,900
@Men and women of all ages, if you're curious, you can come in and listen, SBS Bae Sung-jae's Ten

387
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:20,700
It's Luda's Ten with special DJ Luda, not Bae Sung-jae.

388
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,360
Somehow, the third part started today.

389
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:31,360
We are doing a counseling corner 'Go All Out Spicy Counseling Center' with the wrong man, Jung Yong-guk.

390
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,080
Shall we meet the next worry?

391
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,240
Let's go.

392
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,200
Mr. 'Lee Soon-bong' sent it, he's a man.

393
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,360
There is ginseng liquor at home, I drank it all secretly and filled it with plain water

394
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,660
My wife says she wants to drink it with the family this holiday to celebrate our son's employment.

395
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,400
What should I do? Yong-guk, did you secretly drink your parents' ginseng liquor when you were young?

396
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,460
What did you do then with your friends?

397
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,000
How much can you drink?

398
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,080
It's my first time talking about my drinking capacity in public.

399
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,000
The drinking capacity is okay. It's okay.

400
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,200
I can drink about a bottle and a half

401
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,200
I hardly drink alcohol at all.

402
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,200
Oh really?

403
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,000
Is that surprising?

404
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,200
You look like you drink a lot.

405
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,000
I see, I've heard that a lot.

406
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
When I met senior Ji Sang-ryeol in the past, he said 'Mongtaeju is a tavern' as soon as he saw me.

407
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
He said that to me, but even though I look like this, I hardly drink alcohol.

408
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
What are you looking for? Now?

409
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
No, no

410
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,200
It's just a story I had.

411
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,200
Yes

412
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:44,200
No, so now, Mr. Lee Soon-bong sent a story that he drank the ginseng liquor he had at home. Do you have any brew liquor at home?

413
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:51,200
No, I don't really brew liquor like that, I'm not that old and I don't really like alcohol.

414
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:59,200
When I go to the countryside, my father has quite a lot of liquor that has been brewed for about 30 years, about 60 bottles, but my father doesn't drink either.

415
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
Why does he brew it?

416
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
For decoration

417
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
Ah

418
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:13,200
But there was a similar incident, you know, snake liquor. A next-door neighbor caught a venomous snake and brewed it, and someone drank it.

419
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,000
Who drank it?

420
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:23,000
This type of liquor needs to be aged for the venom to dissipate. However, the son couldn’t resist and drank it prematurely, then refilled the container with soju.

421
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:34,200
The venom remained potent, and not long after, those who drank the liquor experienced hair loss and their teeth fell out.

422
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
It's exactly the same situation as this story.

423
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,200
Similar situation.

424
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
Yes

425
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,200
I'm sure you've given this a lot of thought, but if I were in your shoes, I would buy ginseng liquor on the internet and fill it up again.

426
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,200
That's what I'm thinking.

427
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
What do you think?

428
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,200
From the wife's point of view, what would you do if your husband drank it all?

429
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,000
I would buy another liquor if it were me

430
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,200
No. I just took this liquor without knowing it for the holiday.

431
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,200
But this is just plain water. Wow, our son got a job. Let's get together this time. Let's get together.

432
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,200
Ah let's eat, let's eat

433
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,200
I brewed it. Oh, it's plain water. What are you going to do?

434
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,200
I have to find it. Now search.

435
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
Are you going to search?

436
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,200
Who is it? Who drank this?

437
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,200
Isn't it just the husband?

438
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,200
Honey, come out.

439
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
No, you're too kind now.

440
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
Honey, come out.

441
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,200
He doesn't even come out when he says he will.

442
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,200
Ah, isn't it just a happening among family?

443
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
Hmm. Is that so?

444
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
Yes.

445
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:37,200
I mean, my husband is a married man now. If ginseng liquor is expensive when I search the internet, I might not be able to afford it. If I worry about that, I have to break the bottle.

446
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
You're violent.

447
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
No, it's not violent.

448
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:49,200
No, it's a very pleasant thing and all the relatives are gathered, but if there's plain water in the ginseng liquor, wouldn't it be obvious what you did?

449
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,000
So I break it before that.

450
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,200
Destruction of evidence?

451
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,200
'What should I do? I spilled it.' It seems like a good way to make an excuse.

452
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,200
Is it good?

453
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
Yes

454
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
You said it was violent earlier

455
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,200
I don't break this bottle with a scream, I break it with a surprise

456
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:11,000
Yes, it's broken with a surprise. 'Honey, what should I do, it's like this.' You have to say. If you take plain water thinking 'It'll be fine.', it's a disaster.

457
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:19,200
That's right, but both seem to get hit. I think I'll get hit if I just take it. I think I'll get hit if I break it.

458
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,200
Getting hit in front of relatives and getting hit here is different.

459
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
Is that so?

460
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,000
Because now, the son got a job, that's the most important thing.

461
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:35,200
You might hear, ‘Your dad has messed up again.’ Isn’t it a holiday that you meet after a long time? I’m going to spin it into a bit of a self-made drama.

462
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,200
Then if the wife feels a little better, she can ask 'Are you hurt?' up to that point

463
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,200
If she doesn't even ask that, it's just inevitable.

464
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
You have to move on like this.

465
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,200
I see, then Yong-guk's point.

466
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,200
This is why fights break out when you drink like this on holidays.

467
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
Hmm

468
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
You don't understand, do you?

469
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
Yes.

470
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,200
I don't understand.

471
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,200
Well, that's what it is.

472
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,200
Yes

473
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,200
Let's move on, just yes and move on. If we keep doing this, there will be a story that fits our Luda.

474
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,000
But there's a comment saying 'Isn't it better to just be honest?'

475
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,200
I think so too, just honestly say 'I drank it.'

476
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,200
'I'm sorry.' Isn't that better?

477
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:23,200
Now, that's a comment thrown because we don't know the personality of Mr. Soon-bong's wife.

478
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,000
Do you think he hasn't thought, "I can just be honest and tell my wife?

479
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,200
That's why he sent you the story, isn't it? 'Nobody knows the personality.' That's the point.

480
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,200
I see

481
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
Yes, let's go to the next story

482
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,200
Mr. 'Very Nice' sent a story, he's a man.

483
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,000
I'm a dieter, so I only drink cafe latte instead of lunch.

484
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
But I don't know any of the fun stories shared during lunch.

485
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I can't follow when they go to buy coffee after eating.

486
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Because I've already had coffee.

487
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
So I'm gradually being ostracized, and this is subtly stressful.

488
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,200
Even if I don't eat, can I follow the restaurant with a cafe latte? Would that be more strange? He sent it.

489
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:11,200
You're not being ostracized, you were alone from the beginning. That's how I see it.

490
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,200
Hmm

491
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:18,200
When someone keeps walking around with a coffee while others are eating, no one cares if that person is a dieter or something. They just think, ‘Is he out of money?

492
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,200
What? What is that?

493
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
You can think like that.

494
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,200
How do you know if there's latte, plain water, or green tea in it?

495
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,200
Who thinks like that?

496
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,000
Hmm. Then what do you think?

497
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,200
He's carrying a tumbler, so he must be eating something.

498
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
Tumbler, no, I believe the listener who sent in the story is a man.

499
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,200
Men don't use Tumblr well.

500
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,000
Then just a paper cup?

501
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,200
No, not a paper cup, but a disposable cup from the cafe.

502
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,200
Well, you usually see the contents.

503
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,200
If there's something hot outside, can't you see the inside well?

504
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,200
But do you think he's going to put plain water in there and drink green tea?

505
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,200
No, I mean, people might not think it's expensive.

506
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,200
Every time I eat, he always carries that around

507
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,200
Hmm

508
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,000
Do you think 'Is he having financial difficulties?'

509
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Whether he's financially difficult or what he's done with his money.

510
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
When I see it, it doesn't look good.

511
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
If he didn't explain that he's a dieter, people wouldn't know, right?

512
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,200
That's right. That's true.

513
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,200
So people might find it a little difficult to start a conversation.

514
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,000
'He seems to have some story.'

515
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,200
But 'Ppaceyong' said, 'These days, coffee is more expensive than lunch.'

516
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,200
It's been expensive for a long time.

517
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,200
We eat cheaper things more. You know.

518
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,200
'Ah-ah'(Iced Americano)

519
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,200
Yes

520
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:31,200
Usually, the coffee price range that our store staff drink a lot is 2,000 won

521
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,200
'Ah-ah' 2,000 won

522
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,200
'Ah-ah' is 2,000 won, and if you discount it, it's 1,800 won

523
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,200
Hmm.

524
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,200
Of course, there are expensive places, but you won't carry around what's in expensive places, will you?

525
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:48,200
So I have to eat with people and listen to fun stories, but since I don't eat, I feel like I'm being ostracized.

526
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,200
The most important thing is that this is all part of social life.

527
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,200
Eating and mingling with people and drinking coffee,

528
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,200
This is all part of social life

529
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,200
You have to go like that unconditionally

530
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,200
Then he'll have to follow the restaurant with a cafe latte. Then

531
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,200
No, he has to go and eat something, even if he pretend to eat.

532
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,200
Even if he pretend to eat? Because It's kind of awkward to bring a paper cup.

533
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,200
It looks like he only has this property.

534
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,000
If he brought a cafe latte.

535
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:18,200
So it's not that he only has that property, but I agree that it's part of social life. This is totally part of social life.

536
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,200
No, if he's the boss, he can do this

537
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,000
If he's the boss, thank you.

538
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
If he's the boss, it doesn't matter at all, but he keeps feeling ostracized.

539
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
When he go to the coffee shop again, 'I have coffee, so it's awkward to go.' So

540
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,200
If he’s not going to be in social life for just a day or two, he has to adapt to it

541
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,200
That's right. I agree

542
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,200
That's how you know what people are talking about.

543
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:46,200
If I'm unique and I'm left out, it's not really special, it's ostracized.

544
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,200
I think so.

545
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I see, Park In-kyu said, 'In conclusion, Yong-guk doesn't get along well with Luda. Keke.'

546
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,200
I'll take it as my fault for now

547
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,200
No, what's wrong? Then 'Yong-guk's point.'

548
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,200
The fun story shared while eating is most likely to be his gossip.

549
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,200
"Why does he only drink coffee?"

550
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,200
Yes, I understand. Let's move on.

551
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,200
Next story

552
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,200
'Yongsang' sent it. She's a woman.

553
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:28,200
I have a complex about my long face. So when I take a picture, I use a filter that makes my face look short.

554
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,200
Oh

555
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,200
When I match my face, the faces of the people next to me are excessively reduced, so I don't take pictures with other people as much as possible.

556
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:42,200
But my friends are upset that I don't take any pictures with them and only post selfies and background pictures.

557
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,000
Should I tell them honestly in this case?

558
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,200
I just found out that there's a filter like this

559
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,200
There's a filter that makes your face look short

560
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,200
These days, you can adjust everything, almost anything.

561
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,200
There are a lot of fake faces.

562
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,200
Yes, you can just create new ones. Probably.

563
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,200
Right

564
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:05,200
Because of that, I think her friends are deliberately talking about it.

565
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,000
Wrong!

566
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,200
Why do you think friends wouldn't know?

567
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,200
Can I ask a question?

568
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,000
Can you socialize?

569
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,200
I go alone. I'm a self-employed person, aren't I?

570
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:26,200
Of course, but we're comedians, so we talk. You have a long face, very long.

571
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Just open it.

572
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,200
Here are ordinary office workers. And do friends not know this at all?

573
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,200
Wouldn't they know I'm using my filter? They all know.

574
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,200
But these days, there's no one who doesn't use a filter.

575
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,200
So.

576
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,200
No one.

577
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,200
You roughly know what kind of filter it is. At first, there was Snow or something, right?

578
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,200
Right

579
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:51,200
We use that basically and use various things, but for some reason, they have nothing to say to her.

580
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,200
"Hey, why don’t you take a picture with us?” They just said it out of courtesy,

581
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,200
I think this person is paying too much attention here. That's what I think.

582
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,200
The conclusion is that friends know everything.

583
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,200
Yes, so you don't have to worry at all.

584
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,200
Ignore it

585
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,200
Yes, but if it's comfortable to talk honestly, you can talk.

586
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,200
If you're upset again, your friends will think, "She's not telling us on purpose because of that."

587
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,200
Instead of being secretive, talk honestly and ignore it as much as possible.

588
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,200
What will you do?

589
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,200
If my face is a bit long, let's take a picture with friends. If we take it together, it shrinks and looks weird.

590
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,200
What would you say if your friends asked why you don't take pictures?

591
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,000
If it were me, I would just take it. What's wrong with your friend's face looking like this?

592
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,200
Oh, your friend's face looks like this? As long as you look pretty?

593
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,200
So what, I look good in the picture.

594
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,200
This is the answer because you see a good picture of yourself.

595
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
Right, right

596
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,200
First, take it. Like Luda said, just take a picture and your friend's face

597
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,200
Even if it becomes a pizza, as long as you look pretty. Please take it quickly.

598
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,200
After taking it, say, "Hey, is your face a pizza?"

599
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:07,200
Let's do that. It doesn't seem like a good solution, but let's do that for now.

600
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,200
'Yong-guk's point'

601
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,200
Is it very long?

602
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,200
?

603
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,200
Why? No, play the xylophone a little.

604
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Is it very long? What should I hit?

605
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,200
I'm a little curious too.

606
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,200
Yes, I just asked.

607
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,200
Yes, we're starting Part 4

608
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,200
'He said' sent 'Devil Duo'.

609
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,200
We're talking, right? Probably.

610
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,200
There are only two of us, so it must be us

611
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,200
Oh, come on.

612
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:47,200
'BFP' said, 'Wow, the DJ and the guest are the worst. Kekeke.'

613
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,200
'Jeon Byung-gok' said, 'Today's broadcast is overall precarious.'

614
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,200
Hey, what's precarious about this?

615
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,200
With this much.

616
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,200
Is it okay?

617
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,200
I'm doing very well normally.

618
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,200
It's normal. It's normal.

619
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,200
'An Kyung-seon', this person is a man

620
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,200
He sent a story.

621
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:13,200
I'm preparing for a job. My college senior asked me to help with some work, so I helped a few times to put it in my portfolio.

622
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,200
Now, he calls me anytime as if he thinks of me as an employee.

623
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:23,200
Without paying me. He says, "I'm helping you to get a job well," and I can't believe it.

624
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,200
I think I'll be working in the same industry, is there a way to end it nicely?

625
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:40,200
First of all, what I feel is that if he doesn't pay him now, he won't pay him even if sender do harder work in the future.

626
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,200
If he pays a lot, he will give him 10,000 won.

627
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,200
He won't pay him even if sender help him more.

628
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,200
And you can just not answer the phone.

629
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,200
There is a limit to what you can do without any reward.

630
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,200
Hmm..

631
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,200
He's used to it and thinks it's natural.

632
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
Hmm, I think so

633
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,200
The senior is just a senior when you're in school,

634
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:05,200
Because he becomes just an acquaintance when you need him, you don't need to be swayed too much.

635
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,200
That's what I think.

636
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:12,200
But the problem is that he thinks he'll be working in the same industry, so he wants to end it nicely.

637
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,200
sender hasn't got a job yet. he could still fail.

638
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,200
Right, it might not be the same industry.

639
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,200
That's something to think about then. Right?

640
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,200
Right?

641
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,200
Yes

642
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,200
You can worry about that once you get a job.

643
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,200
You don't need to think about the worries that won't come now,

644
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,200
Aren't you uncomfortable with the current situation?

645
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,200
Right

646
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,200
And from the sender's story, it seems like you're quite skilled.

647
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,200
Then the feeling will change again when the time comes.

648
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,200
So don't stress about bringing the situation ahead now,

649
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:49,200
Now, even though this senior is looking for you, aren't you uncomfortable?

650
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,200
Then you can block it,

651
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,200
'I don't answer', so you don't need to be sorry,

652
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,200
If you use someone, you have to pay a price.

653
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,200
Right.

654
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,200
That's why you don't get dragged to the Ministry of Employment and Labor. There's that.

655
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,200
So 'even though I think I'll be working in the same industry, I haven't yet.' Just ignore it?

656
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,200
Right.

657
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,200
You mean that.

658
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,200
That's the best. Even if you make an excuse, you know. While saying just one last time,

659
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,200
"Hey, I'm taking care of you on purpose." Isn't this a non-abuse of power?

660
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,200
Hmm

661
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:26,200
You only get stressed and it's not a talent donation, and it's not once or twice, so it's uncomfortable.

662
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,200
So now that you've done enough, think about the future,

663
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,200
Now you can just block it.

664
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,200
In the comments, 'Another person like that is already rumored.'

665
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,200
Where is the rumor?

666
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,200
In the same industry, a person who doesn't pay and uses people

667
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,200
The rumor is already out, a comment came up

668
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,200
This person seems like someone who doesn't work at a company

669
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,200
Huh?

670
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,200
You're not working, are you?

671
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:56,200
No, how narrow is the industry that the rumor is out? Now, if a company says 'Assistant manager. Kim', do you know?

672
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,200
You don't know.

673
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,200
So it's a portfolio. It's not a company.

674
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,200
It's just a throwaway comment

675
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,200
So you don't have to find meaning in everything. Just throw it away.

676
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,200
There are a lot of people like that. You don't have to worry too much.

677
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,200
So what's the way to end it nicely?

678
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,200
Now just block it.

679
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,200
Block

680
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,200
Yes.

681
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,200
If I'm good, it's good.

682
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,200
Right

683
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,200
Yes, that's better.

684
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,200
'Yong-guk's point'

685
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,200
I think I should end it badly.

686
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,200
You should block and not see each other, and you should go your separate ways.

687
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,200
That's not bad.

688
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,200
Right. The best way to end it is if I'm good, it's good.

689
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,200
Right, if I'm good, it's good.

690
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,200
'Kim Sung-hee' sent it as 'gender unknown'.

691
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,200
I like gelato, so I often go to the gelato shop.

692
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,200
I'm the one who buys and eats gelato,

693
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,200
The employee keeps smiling at my friend.

694
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,200
They don't talk to each other, but I'm jealous.

695
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,200
Is there a way to get the employee's attention?

696
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,200
What was this story about?

697
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,200
Gelato?

698
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,200
Do people these days eat gelato well?

699
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,200
I like it

700
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,200
Really?

701
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,200
But it's expensive, so I don't eat it often.

702
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,200
What exactly is gelato? I don't know exactly.

703
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,200
Isn't it Turkish ice cream? Gelato?

704
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,200
Ah

705
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,200
There's that chewy ice cream.

706
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,200
Is that gelato?

707
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,200
Yes, I guess so

708
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,200
It's called Italian ice cream.

709
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,200
It's Italian ice cream.

710
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,200
I got it, they wrote it here again because I couldn't recognize it.

711
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,200
Italian ice cream

712
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,200
I don't even eat Korean ice cream, so what Italian ice cream do I eat?

713
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,200
But now the employee smiles at his friend.

714
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,200
There must be a reason.

715
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,200
Right, because he looks funny.

716
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,200
He looks funny, so he laughs.

717
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,200
That could be the case.

718
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,200
When we do comedy, the most comfortable thing is,

719
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,200
Makeup.

720
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,200
It bursts as soon as it appears.

721
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,200
But you know that, whether it's funny or not,

722
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,200
Or if he laughs strangely.

723
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,200
That's just a polite thing to say

724
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,200
she won't look at him

725
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,200
He pays here and gets the goods here, but she's laughing over there.

726
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,200
Then there's no need to talk.

727
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,200
Right. Here's the person who pays the money, and that person doesn't eat,

728
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,200
If she looks at his friend and laughs, he must not have talked.

729
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,200
So what, just at that moment,

730
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,200
This has to be acknowledged, right?

731
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,200
So is there a way to get the employee's attention?

732
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,200
I don't think so.

733
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,200
No. You have to keep asking.

734
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,200
If you try to get attention, don't you just throw strange questions?

735
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,200
When does this come out? Isn't there a new product?

736
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
The employee is very annoyed.

737
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
That's the worst question.

738
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,200
He looks weird and keeps asking weird things.

739
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,200
I feel like this, so I have to go to another store now.

740
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:50,200
It's hard at this store. The employee's gaze is fixed.

741
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,200
'Yong-guk's point'

742
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,200
Just eat gelato.

743
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,200
That's neatly done. There's no point in worrying about that.

744
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,200
If the person who is receiving my money doesn’t look at me, there's no answer. This is.

745
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,200
Right, why do you need to get the employee's attention? Right.

746
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,200
It's not coming anyway.

747
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,200
Look over there, that's what it is.

748
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,200
I found out for the first time today that it's Italian ice cream.

749
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:16,200
Me too. I didn't know it was Italian ice cream while I was eating it deliciously.

750
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,000
Go to the supermarket. Eat Korean ice cream.

751
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I understand.

752
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,200
The fifth part of Luda's Ten has started.

753
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,200
'One Knife' sent 'It's Luda's fifth part, haha'.

754
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,200
It's the first fifth part in the history of Baeten.

755
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,000
I didn't know. Is it the fifth part?

756
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,200
I will try to do up to ten parts later.

757
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:43,200
'Rootray' sent 'Let's love domestic ice cream. Is the ending real?'

758
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,200
Since we can't point out the face. Let's eat domestic ice cream.

759
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:51,200
'Go Dae-sung' sent 'It's a shame that it's over now that we've got the hang of it.'

760
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,200
Luda said, 'I'm very shy.' So, I think she was very surprised to see me.

761
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,200
From next time, I think I'll sit back and talk to you.

762
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,200
I was surprised.

763
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,200
The shortest fifth part

764
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:09,200
If you have any concerns for 'Yonghan Counseling Center', please send them to the Monday bulletin board or,

765
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:15,200
#1077 Short text 50 won, long text 100 won.

766
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,200
We will send a six-pack exchange coupon to those who have been introduced to the story.

767
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,200
Thank you for your hard work today, Mr. Jung Yong-guk.

768
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,200
Today is the first day of Luda's Ten, how was my radio broadcast today?

769
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,200
Ah, it was fun. Yes, it was good.

770
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,200
Monday, September 25, 2023

771
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,200
I'm really proud to finish with the fifth part of Ten.

772
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,000
You've worked hard.

773
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,200
I'll finish Luda's Ten like this,

774
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,200
I'll be back tomorrow.

775
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:46,000
Then I'll turn off the lights. Dream of Luda.
