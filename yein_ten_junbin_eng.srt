1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
Jun-bin: I'm planning to do some promotions for "Devil's Plan,"

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,360
Jun-bin: or perhaps take part in other projects,

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,600
Jun-bin: and I'm thinking of filming a few domestic travels.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,360
Ye-in: Domestic travel?

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,360
Ye-in: That sounds good. At least we can go on domestic trips,

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,540
Ye-in: relatively easily.

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,800
Jun-bin: I'll take a break from overseas travel

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,360
Jun-bin: and probably go out around November.

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,500
Ye-in: November?

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,800
Jun-bin: Can you hear me?

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,200
Production Team: Yes.

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,060
Ye-in: Because it's radio,

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,900
Jun-bin: I feel reassured just by looking at KakaoPot

14
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:35,860
Ye-in: Why?

15
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,900
Jun-bin: I've been doing this for so long,

16
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,800
Jun-bin: it feels like I'm talking with friends.

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,740
Jun-bin: I'm probably more familiar to the audience than those watching BaeTen.

18
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,600
Ye-in: I see.

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,000
Jun-bin: They thought Bae Seong-jae was back,

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Jun-bin: what a compliment.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Jun-bin: These days, he's lost so much weight,

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Ye-in: Right, he's half the man he used to be, literally.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Production Team: Looks unimpressive.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Ye-in: He looks a bit older.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Production Team: He's not here to hear this.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Jun-bin: I'm so jealous though.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Production Team: Bae Seong-jae isn't here.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Ye-in: Honestly, Bae Seong-jae oppa has always been more about pleasing the ears than the eyes.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Jun-bin: Oh, he's not here, wow.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Production Team: Exactly.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Ye-in: They're asking if we know each other well,

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Ye-in: but we're actually meeting for the first time today.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Ye-in: Yes, yes.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Ye-in: It's our first encounter.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Jun-bin: Right, I just feel a bit of inner closeness.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Ye-in: I feel a strong inner closeness too.

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Jun-bin: That's how nonexistent it is, for you to say that.

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Ye-in: Because I've seen all of it.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Jun-bin: What did you see?

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Ye-in: I watched "Wheel Mouth" and

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Ye-in: then there's the "JB(loser)" stuff you did.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Jun-bin: Didn't you watch my YouTube channel?
dfd
43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Ye-in: I did watch some of your acting there.

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Jun-bin: Really?

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Ye-in: But it was all ads.

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Jun-bin: You only see the parts where I appear unfavorably.

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Ye-in: That's not the case.

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Jun-bin: Whenever I meet someone on the street who knows "GwakTube," I greet them warmly,

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Jun-bin: but if they know "Wheel Mouth," my facial expression changes a bit.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Ye-in: Why? I find the character there really fun and genuinely entertaining.

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Jun-bin: You see me as a "JB," which is why I always say as an annual event,

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Jun-bin: "That's all an act. Do you think I would sit there without getting paid?"

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Jun-bin: That's what I say.

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Ye-in: But I think in front of true love,

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Ye-in: doesn't everyone become a "JB"? Isn't that right?

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Ye-in: You become humble and want to do everything for the person you truly love, showing all those "JB" qualities.

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Jun-bin: Oh, you're so warm-hearted.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Ye-in: Because that's how it is. You only act selfishly towards someone you don't like,

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Ye-in: but in front of someone you really like, you become smaller, wanting to do well by them, showing all aspects of being a "JB."

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Jun-bin: It feels like we're already doing the "Non-Romantic Champions League." We haven't even started yet.

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Jun-bin: But really, the chat content and the way of speaking feel so familiar,

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Jun-bin: like I'm back in my hometown, and it's very comforting.

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Jun-bin: Lately, I've only seen polished comments, so this feels warm.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Ye-in: Are YouTube comments more refined?

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Jun-bin: As the channel grows,

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Jun-bin: more people tend to respond warmly rather than critically,

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Jun-bin: so I've seen a lot of refined comments,

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Jun-bin: but here, the podcast listeners

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Jun-bin: still treat me as the highest "podcast veteran." To me, they're all newcomers.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Ye-in: Newcomers? Like a new Dobby?

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Ye-in: Right? Right?

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Jun-bin: What do you usually do for fun at home?

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Ye-in: I enjoy watching movies, and if I had enough money and time, I'd travel just like you.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Ye-in: Earlier this year, I didn't have money but had plenty of time, so I traveled a bit.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Jun-bin: Really?

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Ye-in: I even went to Hawaii.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Jun-bin: Because you had money and time?

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Ye-in: No money, but plenty of time.

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Jun-bin: Then you can't go to Hawaii?

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Ye-in: I went to Hawaii at that time.

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Jun-bin: But Hawaii is expensive.

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Ye-in: But I went, and it really was expensive. Every meal there was costly.

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Jun-bin: I was shocked by the prices in Hawaii, especially because of the tips.

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Jun-bin: With tips included, even simple meals can cost around 20-30,000 won.

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Ye-in: Even a sandwich, just a basic one with some salmon, costs about 20-30,000 won.

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Jun-bin: So, a sandwich is 20,000 won, and a meal can be 30,000 to 40,000 won.

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Ye-in: Right, I also went to Osaka.

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Ye-in: Just yesterday, there were three of us, all noisy,

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Jun-bin: Who was on yesterday?

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Ye-in: Yesterday, our members were on.

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Jun-bin: Which members came?

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Ye-in: Ji-ae unnie and Su-jeong unnie.

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Jun-bin: Oh.

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Ye-in: Who do you like the most in Lovelyz?

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Jun-bin: I like Ye-in the most.

96
00:04:

49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Ye-in: Correct.

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Ye-in: [Everyone in the radio studio laughs.]

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Production Team: Why do both of you sound like robots?

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Jun-bin: I'm a bit nervous,

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,500
Jun-bin: because I'm a fan of Lovelyz.

101
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
Production Team: We have some acting coming up.

102
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,500
Production Team: Both of you.

103
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,500
Jun-bin: If we're going to act,

104
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
Ye-in: It's a love scene, right?

105
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Ye-in: Mr. GwakTube,

106
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,000
Jun-bin: I don't think I can do it.

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Jun-bin: Maybe it's better if you do it alone.

108
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Ye-in: No way.

109
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,500
Ye-in: Jun-bin oppa, can I start?

110
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,500
Ye-in: That's the first thing.

111
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Jun-bin: It's tough.

112
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Ye-in: Oppa,

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,500
Jun-bin: This is harder than 'Devil's Plan.'

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Production Team: There's a part where you make a fart sound.

115
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Jun-bin: Got it.

116
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Production Team: Mr. GwakTube,

117
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Jun-bin: Normally, people who draw lines say Mr. GwakTube.

118
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Jun-bin: Right?

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Ye-in: Because,

120
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Ye-in: If I suddenly call you oppa since we just met,

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Ye-in: It might be burdensome.

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Production Team: There's also this,

123
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Ye-in: Ah, Mr. Jun-bin, Mr. Jun-bin,

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Ye-in: Somehow, Mr. Jun-bin feels a bit distant.

125
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Jun-bin: No, I like being called by my name.

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Ye-in: Then, Jun-bin?

127
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Ye-in: [Everyone laughs]

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Ye-in: I'll call you Jun-bin oppa.

129
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Production Team: It's competitive.

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Ye-in: Can I call you oppa?

131
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Ye-in: During the broadcast,

132
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Production Team: On the broadcast,

133
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Ye-in: Mr. Jun-bin,

134
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Production Team: Yes, yes.

135
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Ye-in: Okay, got it.

136
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Jun-bin: This broadcast is a bit strange.

137
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Jun-bin: No, it's not.

138
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Production Team: But, like now,

139
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Production Team: When it's not included, you can call him oppa.

140
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Ye-in: Since it's only my second time as a DJ,

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Ye-in: I might stutter a bit, but I'll do my best.

142
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Jun-bin: I haven't done much radio either,

143
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Jun-bin: so it feels awkward.

144
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Ye-in: You've done much tougher things than radio.

145
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Jun-bin: That may be true, but radio is just

146
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Jun-bin: my voice going out, so it's okay, but also nerve-wracking because it's live.

147
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Jun-bin: I used to do live broadcasts a lot in the past,

148
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Jun-bin: but I've reduced them lately.

149
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Jun-bin: Afraid of making a mistake?

150
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Ye-in: Yes, yes.

151
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Jun-bin: Yes.

152
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Ye-in: Right, you have something to maintain.

153
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Ye-in: That's why I rarely do live broadcasts.

154
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Jun-bin: I used to do live twice a week.

155
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Ye-in: Really?

156
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Jun-bin: Yes, I loved doing live.

157
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Jun-bin: Lately, I've been watching mostly streaming stuff,

158
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Jun-bin: like game streaming.

159
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Jun-bin: I'm actually pretty good with live,

160
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Jun-bin: but I've been more cautious lately.

161
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Production Team: Alright, let's start with the opening.

162
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Production Team: This Sunday, October 8th, opening.

163
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Ye-in: 'Breaking news'

164
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Ye-in: 'GwakTube'

165
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Ye-in: 'A swimming hopeful inspired by the Hangzhou Asian Games'

166
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Ye-in: 'A man who becomes a hot topic no matter what he does'

167
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Ye-in: Hello, it's Sunday, October 8th, 2023.

168
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Ye-in: Filling in for DJ Bae Seong-jae, who's away for the Asian Games broadcast,

169
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Ye-in: I'm Special DJ Jung Ye-in, bringing you Jung Ye-in's Ten.

170
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Ye-in: The first song was Oh My Girl's 'Dolphin.'

171
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
10 o'clock headlines: GwakTube, a swimming hopeful inspired by the Hangzhou Asian Games

172
00:07

:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Ye-in: A man who becomes a hot topic no matter what he does.

173
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Ye-in: GwakTube posted a picture at the pool on Instagram, and it immediately became news.

174
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Ye-in: Seeing news made from SNS, he really seems to be a hot topic.

175
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Ye-in: Here's the photo attached,

176
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Ye-in: looking cute in a red hat, but the water looks shallow.

177
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Ye-in: Watching the video he posted,

178
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Ye-in: he was learning basic moves with a kickboard.

179
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Ye-in: If you're going to swim, you should learn diligently,

180
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Ye-in: like Mr. GwakTube.

181
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Ye-in: Like him,

182
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,920
Ye-in: those inspired by the Asian Games to register for swimming,

183
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,180
Ye-in: badminton, and table tennis,

184
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:26,900
Ye-in: are numerous.

185
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,940
Ye-in: Please don't just burn out during the Asian Games period,

186
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,560
Ye-in: and continue to exercise healthily for a long time.

187
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,100
Ye-in: Got it, Mr. GwakTube?

188
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,900
Jun-bin: Yes, I'll be careful.

189
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,320
Ye-in: Non-Romantic Champions League

190
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,340
Ye-in: Let's do it again.

191
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,360
Ye-in: In the Non-Romantic Champions League corner,

192
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,500
Ye-in: it's hard to tease singles since I'm in the same boat,

193
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,420
Ye-in: so instead of non-romance,

194
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,440
Ye-in: let's slightly change to a miserable corner for bad manners.

195
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,040
Ye-in: We'll go with the Bad Manners Champions League.

196
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,260
Ye-in: And we have a very special

197
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,660
Ye-in: guest with us,

198
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,320
Ye-in: a man who fits well with BaeTen,

199
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,400
Ye-in: travel YouTuber GwakTube.

200
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,480
Ye-in: So, together with him,

201
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,580
Ye-in: we'll judge the bad manner stories of those who cross the line.

202
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,440
Ye-in: This is Jung Ye-in's Ten.

203
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,180
Ye-in: You can watch the entire recording process of YengTen,

204
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,040
Ye-in: and participate in the chat by entering the original DJ BaeDi's name, Bae Seong-jae, in KakaoTV,

205
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,880
Ye-in: or by visiting the Erao channel on YouTube.

206
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,480
Ye-in: You can also join the chat there,

207
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,600
Ye-in: so feel free to come in and play with us.

208
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,040
Ye-in: Now, let's introduce the gifts.

209
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Ye-in: Then, we'll be back after the commercials.

210
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,000
Production Team: We'll start the corner now.

211
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,160
Ye-in: Jun-bin-kun, if you don't know Lovelyz's songs in front of Lovelyz,

212
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,520
Ye-in: that's bad manners, you know.

213
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,000
Ye-in: Do you know any Lovelyz songs?

214
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,520
Jun-bin: I'd love to sing many, but my favorite is definitely 'Ah-Choo.'

215
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,800
Jun-bin: You have to sing a verse to move on.

216
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,500
Jun-bin: 'I want to make something delicious for you'

217
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,560
Ye-in: I'm gonna die of hunger.

218
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:23,960
Jun-bin: Yes.

219
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,820
Ye-in: Ah, that's 'Ah-Choo.' Thank you.

220
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,880
Ye-in: Aww.

221
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,500
Jun-bin: Thank you.

222
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,280
Ye-in: You pass.

223
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,800
Ye-in: You're acknowledged as a manner man.

224
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,040
Ye-in: Since I've subscribed to GwakTube as well,

225
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,520
Ye-in: do you acknowledge me as a manner girl?

226
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,860
Jun-bin: Oh, absolutely, I acknowledge you.

227
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,620
Ye-in: Ah, thank you.

228
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,560
Jun-bin: It's acknowledging each other as manner man

229
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,060
Jun-bin: GwakTube and manner girl

230
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,700
Jun-bin: YengDi, and

231
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,540
Jun-bin: we'll precisely pick out

232
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,520
Jun-bin: the annoyingly bad-mannered people around us

233
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,360
Jun-bin: and criticize them.

234
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,440
Ye-in: Miserable Special Bad Manners

235
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,420
Jun-bin: Champions League

236
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,720
Ye-in: Oh, the BG gets grand.

237
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,840
Ye-in: Today's Bad Manners Champions League, joining us today is

238
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,220
Ye-in: a vibrant travel creator

239
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,220
Ye-in: a friend of singles

240
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,380
Ye-in: surpassing the hope of bashful BaeTen enthusiasts,

241
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,180
Ye-in: now a celebrity among celebrities,

242
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,880
Ye-in: a celeb among celebs.

243
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,920
Ye-in: And having appeared on the brain game survival show,

244
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,340
Ye-in: demonstrating his intelligence as well,

245
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,000
Ye-in: the most trending broadcaster nowadays,

246
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,080
Ye-in: GwakTube, Gwak Jun-bin, welcome.

247
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,160
Jun-bin: Hello, I'm Gwak Jun-bin, a travel creator

248
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,780
Jun-bin: and currently appearing on "Devil's Plan."

249
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,220
Jun-bin: Nice to meet you.

250
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:24,860
Jun-bin: Glad to be here.

251
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,660
Ye-in: Wow, a celebrity.

252
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,640
Ye-in: You visited BaeTen last October,

253
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,740
returning after a year not to BaeTen but

254
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,080
Ye-in: to YengTen. Welcome back.

255
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,760
Jun-bin: I'm really glad to be back.

256
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,460
Ye-in: And you're a fan of Lovelyz,

257
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,140
Ye-in: so it's really nice that you mentioned that right away,

258
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,020
Ye-in: making me feel very good.

259
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,780
Ye-in: But in fact, we're meeting for the first time, right?

260
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,540
Jun-bin: Yes, this is our first meeting.

261
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,840
Ye-in: But we feel a kind of inner closeness, don't we?

262
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,700
Jun-bin: Absolutely, I feel a huge closeness.

263
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,580
Ye-in: I also feel a strong inner closeness.

264
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,860
Ye-in: "Ah-Choo" is your favorite among our songs,

265
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,940
Ye-in: and what other song do you like?

266
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,280
Jun-bin: So, we're starting the Bad Manners Champions League, but

267
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,740
Jun-bin: I actually know a lot, but I can't remember right now.

268
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,440
Ye-in: You're preparing to stretch your tongue, right?

269
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,360
Ye-in: To make it longer.

270
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,240
Jun-bin: No, really,

 I know, but I can't remember right now.

271
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,960
Jun-bin: You suddenly asked me.

272
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,860
Ye-in: How many members are in Lovelyz?

273
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,420
Jun-bin: I can even tell you all the members' names of Lovelyz.

274
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,120
Ye-in: Really?

275
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,160
Jun-bin: Yes.

276
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,380
Ye-in: My name is

277
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:22,920
Jun-bin: Jung Ye-in.

278
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,840
Ye-in: Right, right.

279
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,880
Ye-in: Who's your favorite member?

280
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,380
Jun-bin: Jung Ye-in.

281
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,040
Ye-in: That's right, that's right.

282
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,960
Jun-bin: I can talk about all the other members too.

283
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,740
Ye-in: Thank you so much.

284
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,480
Ye-in: When you heard Jun-bin was coming,

285
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,560
Ye-in: comments like this came up.

286
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,960
Ye-in: Hong Tae-young said,

287
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,780
Ye-in: 'This combination... (what does it mean?)'

288
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,640
Ye-in: like this.

289
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,320
Jun-bin: That's something I use a lot

290
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,200
Jun-bin: in my channel content.

291
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,440
Ye-in: Yes!

292
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,600
Jun-bin: When I'm sort of flirting with girls,

293
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,720
Jun-bin: and nobody thinks it's anything,

294
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,120
Jun-bin: but I pretend it's something by saying, 'What does it mean?'

295
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,320
Jun-bin: I hope you don't misunderstand too much.

296
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,720
Jun-bin: I didn't want to start off too burdensome.

297
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,660
Jun-bin: But you're kind of a person who causes a lot of misunderstandings.

298
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,760
Ye-in: Yes, because, well, when we travel, I don't know who I'll go with,

299
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,700
Ye-in: but sure, we can go together.

300
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,200
Jun-bin: Not at all.

301
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,660
Jun-bin: I don't even contact female friends.

302
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,120
Ye-in: Right, it's either dating or strangers.

303
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,940
Jun-bin: Yes, exactly.

304
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,200
Jun-bin: I do have female colleagues, though.

305
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,900
Ye-in: So, can we be work colleagues then?

306
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,000
Jun-bin: Starting off by drawing lines like this...

307
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,840
Ye-in: [Everyone laughs]

308
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,280
Ye-in: No, no, because I don't want to be a stranger, so

309
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:16,940
Jun-bin: Yes, yes, yes.

310
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,840
Ye-in: we can play board games and spend time together like that, right?

311
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,360
Jun-bin: Often?

312
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,440
Ye-in: Like, we can get together often.

313
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,980
Jun-bin: Should I use 'What does it mean?' now?

314
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,900
Ye-in: Oh! The word 'often'!

315
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,260
Ye-in: I'm being very careful with my words today.

316
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,600
Jun-bin: You should be careful with me too.

317
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,080
Ye-in: Yes, yes.

318
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,520
Ye-in: I usually like to talk like this,

319
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,420
Ye-in: but every time you say 'What does it mean?' just tell me directly.

320
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,460
Ye-in: I'll try to be more careful.

321
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,240
Jun-bin: That's a thought I keep to myself,

322
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,680
Jun-bin: so I think the phrase 'What does it mean?' has its own charm.

323
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,920
Ye-in: Ah.

324
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:55,780
Ye-in: Also, Olbyu commented, 'So envious of PaniBottle who's close with BLACKPINK's Jisoo and GwakTube who meets Lovelyz's Ye-in... what are you guys?'

325
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,160
Ye-in: What do you think?

326
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,800
Jun-bin: Well, I think the latter might be true,

327
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,040
Jun-bin: but I'll try my best to make it funny.

328
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,780
Ye-in: Sure, I think we'll get along really well.

329
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,520
Jun-bin: That's why I'm nervous now.

330
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,080
Ye-in: What does it mean?

331
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,860
Ye-in: Are you asking me what it means now?

332
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,000
Jun-bin: Yes, yes, yes.

333
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,940
Jun-bin: I'm getting nervous now,

334
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,780
Jun-bin: I did a radio show last week too,

335
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,280
Jun-bin: I was on Cultwo Show last week, and it was

336
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,280
Jun-bin: my second appearance on SBS, but

337
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,280
Jun-bin: this feels three times more nerve-wracking.

338
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,280
Ye-in: Really?

339
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,280
Ye-in: You'll get used to it soon and your nerves will melt away.

340
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:33,780
Ye-in: Also, Kuku1204 commented, 'PaniBottle is close with BLACKPINK's Jisoo and GwakTube meets Lovelyz's Ye-in... you guys are so lucky.. what are you?'

341
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,780
Ye-in: Like this.

342
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,780
Jun-bin: It's Lovelyz's Jisoo, but

343
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,280
Ye-in: Yeah, Jisoo unnie and I are really close too,

344
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,780
Jun-bin: I don't know BLACKPINK's Jisoo at all,

345
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,280
Ye-in: You don't know each other?

346
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,280
Jun-bin: Not at all,

347
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,280
Ye-in: Really?

348
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
Ye-in: Right.

349
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,280
Ye-in: I thought you liked the name Jisoo.

350
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,280
Jun-bin: Not at all,

351
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,280
Jun-bin: I played board games with Jisoo at PaniBottle's house once.

352
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,280
Ye-in: See, without me,

353
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,280
Jun-bin: How could I know

354
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,280
Ye-in: Contact Jisoo unnie, then

355
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,280
Ye-in: let's do it together next time.

356
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,280
Jun-bin: Do we really need to go through her?

357
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,780
Ye-in: What does it mean?

358
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,280
Jun-bin: You can't just use that randomly.

359
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,280
Jun-bin: I was serious... never mind.

360
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,280
Ye-in: Alright, I understand.

361
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,900
Ye-in: How was it meeting Jisoo unnie?

362
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,000
Jun-bin: She was really fun and cheerful, right?

363
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,280
Ye-in: Yes.

364
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
Jun-bin: Her personality seems very similar to yours.

365
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,280
Ye-in: Yes, Lovelyz,

366
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,280
Ye-in: though our group name is Lovelyz,

367
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,280
Ye-in: we're actually like bold warriors in personality,

368
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,280
Ye-in: so we're very straightforward.

369
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
Jun-bin: She was quite bold.

370
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,280
Ye-in: Yes, next time I want to join too.

377
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,280
Ye-in: Jun-bin, these days you're so popular that there's hardly anyone who doesn't know you.

378
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,280
Ye-in: Do you actually feel the popularity?

379
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,280
Ye-in: Are you aware of your popularity?

380
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,280
Jun-bin: Rather than popularity, I guess I'm starting to really feel the recognition.

381
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,280
Jun-bin: For example, even today, after swimming,

382
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,280
Jun-bin: the ladies at the pool recognized me and kept greeting me.

383
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,280
Jun-bin: They knew me even at the swimming pool.

384
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,280
Ye-in: Wow, even the ladies there?

385
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,280
Jun-bin: Yes, yes.

386
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,280
Jun-bin: But it's the first time someone said to me

387
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,280
Jun-bin: that I look better on broadcast than in person.

388
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,280
Ye-in: Oh, better on screen than in person.

389
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,280
Ye-in: But that's actually a compliment.

390
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,280
Ye-in: Because, ultimately, more people see us on TV, like a hundred or two hundred times more.

391
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,280
Ye-in: Looking better on TV isn't easy, you know.

392
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,280
Ye-in: It's hard to look better on TV.

393
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,280
Ye-in: Than in person.

394
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,280
Jun-bin: So I was a bit embarrassed then.

395
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,280
Ye-in: No, but seeing you in person,

396
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,280
Ye-in: it's definitely not like that.

397
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,280
Ye-in: You look just the same as on TV.

398
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,280
Jun-bin: That's the comment I hear the most.

399
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,280
Jun-bin: That I look the same.

400
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,280
Ye-in: Exactly, yes.

401
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,280
Ye-in: How can someone be so consistent? I hear that a lot.

402
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,280
Ye-in: What about me?

403
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,000
Ye-in: Between TV and real life, which looks better?

404
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,280
Jun-bin: In real life, you're much more beautiful.

405
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,280
Ye-in: Thank you.

406
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,280
Ye-in: How satisfied are you with your life these days?

407
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:40,280
Jun-bin: Well, I'm happiest when doing broadcasts like this, satisfied,

408
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,280
Jun-bin: seeing and talking to people I've been a fan of,

409
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,280
Jun-bin:

 face to face.

410
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,280
Jun-bin: Every time I'm on such shows, my happiness increases.

411
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,280
Ye-in: Since you'll continue to be active in broadcasting,

412
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,280
Ye-in: I guess you'll be on shows with even more beautiful celebrities, right?

413
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,280
Jun-bin: I think being friendly with celebrities is more important to me,

414
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,280
Jun-bin: the ones I like.

415
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,280
Ye-in: Don't forget me then, okay?

416
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,280
Jun-bin: Yes, yes, I'll keep coming back.

417
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,000
Ye-in: And you're a travel YouTuber, right?

418
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,280
Ye-in: You're always traveling, where have you been recently?

419
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,280
Jun-bin: Recently, I went on a trip to Central America,

420
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,280
Jun-bin: the last destination was Cuba, with Noh Hong-chul and PaniBottle.

421
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,280
Ye-in: Wow, how was it?

422
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,000
Jun-bin: In Cuba, nothing works, not even phones,

423
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,280
Jun-bin: well, they do but barely,

424
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,280
Jun-bin: it's almost better not to use them because of the stress,

425
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,280
Jun-bin: but everything in the country is like it stopped in the '70s and '80s,

426
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,280
Jun-bin: so it's worth visiting once before you die.

427
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:37,280
Ye-in: It seems like a break from the busy modern society,

428
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,280
Ye-in: returning to our original state.

429
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,000
Jun-bin: Really, there's nothing, just the pure essence, and no food either.

430
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Ye-in: Then what do you eat to live?

431
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,280
Jun-bin: There's nothing tasty, nothing tasty.

432
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,280
Ye-in: Oh, nothing tasty.

433
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,280
Jun-bin: Yes, we just eat spaghetti and pizza, but

434
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,280
Jun-bin: the country itself has so much romance that I recommend visiting at least once.

435
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,280
Ye-in: Oh, at least once.

436
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:03,280
Ye-in: Someday, when I'm tired of this busy modern society,

437
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,280
Jun-bin: Yes, yes, I really recommend it then.

438
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,280
Ye-in: Can I contact you for advice then?

439
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,280
Ye-in: Like, for advice.

440
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,280
Jun-bin: Oh, I thought you were suggesting we go together.

441
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,

280
Jun-bin: You really make a lot of assumptions.

442
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:21,280
Ye-in: Yes, because, who knows, maybe at that time, I don't know who I'll go with,

443
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,280
Ye-in: but sure, we can go together.

444
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,000
Ye-in: Can I write my story for the "Non-Romantic Champions League"?

445
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,280
Ye-in: I'll listen to one of your stories today and then we'll move on. Meanwhile,

446
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:35,280
Ye-in: despite being busy with traveling, you're currently appearing on the popular Tengflix reality show,

447
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,280
Ye-in: "Brain Game Survival Devil's Plan". Did you apply to be on it yourself?

448
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:45,280
Jun-bin: Not exactly an application, but I expressed a lot of interest. I'm a fan of the creator, PD Jong-hyun,

449
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,280
Jun-bin: who has made many programs I greatly admire.

450
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,280
Jun-bin: So, I said I wanted to be on that show, and

451
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,280
Jun-bin: when I was in Korea for travel, I immediately went for an interview and got selected to participate.

452
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,280
Ye-in: What kind of questions do they ask in the interview for such a scary game?

453
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,280
Jun-bin: Surprisingly, they seemed to focus a lot on understanding my personality.

454
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:07,280
Ye-in: Oh......

455
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,280
Jun-bin: I don't remember exactly what I said,

456
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,280
Ye-in: Mm......

457
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,280
Jun-bin: but I think I talked a lot about my feelings and thoughts on games I've seen before.

458
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:19,280
Ye-in: Do you naturally have a smart image?

459
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,280
Jun-bin: I neither have an image nor am I smart.

460
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,280
Ye-in: I haven't watched "Devil's Plan" yet, but I plan to watch it tonight before going to bed.

461
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:33,280
Jun-bin: It's a brain survival show, so people might find it hard to start because it seems difficult,

462
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:39,280
Jun-bin: but it's actually quite accessible, and although the rules explanation is a bit long,

463
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,280
Jun-bin: you can skip it without missing out on understanding the game.

464
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:47,280
Ye-in: Right, why is it so long? I have to reread the beginning because the explanation is too lengthy.

465
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,280
Ye-in: I'm a bit of a dummy.

466
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:57,280
Jun-bin: If it's not long, people might complain about the lack of explanation,

467
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,280
Jun-bin: so they provide it, but you can still follow the game without it, no problem.

468
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:07,000
Ye-in: Unrelated.

469
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,280
Jun-bin: It's a show where you

 can see people's brain battles, political battles.

470
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,280
Ye-in: What was your role there?

471
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,280
Jun-bin: At first, I thought I was the main character, but after watching the broadcast,

472
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,280
Jun-bin: it turned out I was only the main character in interviews.

473
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,280
Ye-in: Who?

474
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,280
Jun-bin: Me. In individual interviews, I talked as if I was the main character,

475
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,280
Jun-bin: but in terms of gameplay, it wasn't really like that.

476
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,280
Ye-in: So, you played dirty?

477
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,280
Jun-bin: Dirty, but also comedic plays were my thing.

478
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,280
Ye-in: Like bluffing?

479
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,280
Jun-bin: Yes, exactly, I was like a comedian there.

480
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:47,280
Ye-in: Maybe that's why you were chosen? Every group needs such a presence.

481
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,280
Jun-bin: Like you said, in interviews, I was like 'Yagami Light' from 'Death Note',

482
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,280
Jun-bin: but in play, just

483
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,280
Ye-in: a passing pedestrian.

484
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,280
Jun-bin: Not quite that, but maybe one of 'Light's targets for manipulation.

485
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,280
Ye-in: Still high up there.

486
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,280
Jun-bin: I wanted to show more of my gameplay, but "Devil's Plan" isn't over yet.

487
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,280
Ye-in: Right, right.

488
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,280
Jun-bin: Not all episodes have been released yet.

489
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:13,280
Ye-in: Right, as of now, up to episode 9 has been released.

490
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,280
Jun-bin: Yes.

491
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:19,280
Ye-in: It says here you played the role of being smitten with yourself in episode 1, is that correct?

492
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,280
Jun-bin: That smugness,

493
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,000
Jun-bin: well, interviews and gameplay are different,

494
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Jun-bin: during gameplay, I think I did well, really well,

495
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,280
Jun-bin: and in interviews, I was like, "Who should I save?" pretending to be all that.

496
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,280
Ye-in: As if the game was in my hands.

497
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,280
Jun-bin: But it turns out, everyone played that way, not just me.

498
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,280
Ye-in: So, it wasn't just me.

499
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,280
Jun-bin: And I watched the program too much, so maybe I caught that bug.

500
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,280
Ye-in: It was filmed early this January

, right?

501
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,280
Jun-bin: Yes.

502
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,000
Ye-in: The results are already out by now,

503
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,280
Ye-in: but can we expect to see more of your actions? Please promote it a bit.

504
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:02,000
Jun-bin: If you want to see my actions, just watch it.

505
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,280
Jun-bin: Because there's a lot of me, I hogged the camera.

506
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,280
Jun-bin: A lot of screentime.

507
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,280
Ye-in: That's the best.

508
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,000
Jun-bin: Seeing someone so overbearing, can he achieve a human victory?

509
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,280
Jun-bin: Maybe that narrative might make it interesting for you.

510
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,280
Ye-in: But it's like an elimination concept, right? So, does it end with a final winner?

511
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,280
Jun-bin: Yes, exactly. The last person takes home up to 500 million won.

512
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,280
5 billion?

513
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,280
Jun-bin: Yes.

514
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,000
Ye-in: Amazing.

515
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,280
Jun-bin: You should keep a good image with me.

516
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,000
Ye-in: Did you win? But if you reveal that here, won't you get taken away?

517
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,280
Ye-in: Like, for breaking contracts or something?

518
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,280
Jun-bin: More than that, the officials

519
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,280
Ye-in: Will they make you spit it out?

520
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,280
Jun-bin: I probably won't be able to show my face on Netflix again.

521
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,280
Ye-in: Ah.

522
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,280
Jun-bin: Tengflix, I mean.

523
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:48,280
Ye-in: Right, right. It's so intriguing, especially after talking to you, I'm even more curious.

524
00:22:48,280 --> 00:23:02,280
Ye-in: Meeting famous people like PD Kim Tae-ho, senior Yoo Jae-suk, senior Park Jung-min, Chillman, senior Noh Hong-chul, senior Jung Hyung-don, and becoming close friends with many, who's your closest friend these days?

525
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,280
Jun-bin: Oh, recently,

526
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:09,000
Jun-bin: until the trip to Cuba, naturally Hong-chul and PaniBottle were my closest friends,

527
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Jun-bin: and this week, I've been meeting players from 'Devil's Plan' like Kyung-rim, Seok-jin, Dong-jun, Gwe-do, Seung-kwan, so I've gotten quite close to them.

528
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,280
Jun-bin: Lately, I've been getting closer to those participants.

529
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,280
Ye-in: Ah, including me then.

530
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:

29,000
Jun-bin: I'll go around saying Ye-in is my closest friend.

531
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,280
Ye-in: Yes, you must say that.

532
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,000
Jun-bin: I've found a friend who wants to eat delicious food.

533
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,280
Ye-in: Delicious food?

534
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,280
Ye-in: Yes, I'm not in charge of cooking, but I was the one who couldn't cook there,

535
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,280
Jun-bin: Ah.

536
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,280
Ye-in: I can't cook, but we can just pay for food, right?

537
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,280
Jun-bin: Right, I might have a lot of money by then.

538
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,000
Ye-in: Exactly.

539
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,280
Jun-bin: I'll buy a lot with that.

540
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:51,280
Ye-in: Right, I'm curious, even if you don't win the prize, do you get paid per episode?

541
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,280
Jun-bin: I'm not sure if I'm allowed to talk about that?

542
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,280
Ye-in: [Everyone in the radio studio laughs.]

543
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,280
Jun-bin: I really want to tell you because the order looks interesting,

544
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,000
Ye-in: Can you tell me after the broadcast is over? I'm just curious about the existence, not the amount.

545
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,280
Jun-bin: Yes. There's an official here, so I'll ask and let you know.

546
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,000
Ye-in: Oh, I'm sorry.

547
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Ye-in: Well, that's it for now. Next time on BaeTen, please come with the 'Devil's Plan'

548
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:14,280
Ye-in: friends you're close with to BaeTen.

549
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,280
Jun-bin: Sure, I'll definitely come.

550
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,280
Ye-in: Alright, let's wrap up. Our next segment, the Bad Manners Champions League, is about

551
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,000
Jun-bin: I'll be there for sure.

552
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,280
Ye-in: Yes, so, we'll introduce texts about bad manners next.

553
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:32,280
Ye-in: If you're unsure whether you're being rude or have stories of others' bad manners, send them in,

554
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:37,280
Ye-in: and we'll empathize and harshly criticize, identifying the bad manners.

555
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,280
Ye-in: The featured stories will receive a 'Sunrise Portable Lantern'.

556
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,000
Jun-bin: Wow, that's really nice.

557
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,280
Ye-in: Jun-bin, are you often told you're mannerly?

558
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,000
Jun-bin: I'm often told I'm all manners.

559
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,280
Ye-in: Manners or nothing at all.

560
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,280


Jun-bin: Literally nothing but manners.

561
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,280
Ye-in: Really? But you play dirty here.

562
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,280
Jun-bin: Ah, it's survival, you see.

563
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,280
Ye-in: Work is work.

564
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,280
Jun-bin: I don't do such things in society.

565
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,280
Ye-in: Ahahaha.

566
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,280
Jun-bin: In society, I'm a super mannerly man.

567
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,280
Ye-in: What kind of manners? There are various kinds of manners, right?

568
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,280
Jun-bin: Mainly, I'm considerate, thinking about how to please the person.

569
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,280
Ye-in: Mm, how to make the person comfortable.

570
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:20,280
Jun-bin: Yes, so I'm not naturally mannerly but rather artificially mannerly.

571
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,280
Ye-in: But that's your charm, you know, being a bit clunky.

572
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,280
Ye-in: You do it because women find it cute, right?

573
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,280
Jun-bin: Well, in my 31 years of life,

574
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,280
Jun-bin: I've been called cute a lot, but

575
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,280
Jun-bin: I've come to feel that it's meaningless.

576
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,280
Ye-in: But you know, being cute is everything?

577
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,280
Ye-in: It's a real charm, more than being cool, beautiful, or smart.

578
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,280
Ye-in: Being cute is truly a significant charm.

579
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,280
Jun-bin: It does seem to have meaning, yeah.

580
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,280
Ye-in: [Everyone in the radio studio laughs.]

581
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,280
Ye-in: What does that mean? [laughs]

582
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,280
Ye-in: Hahaha.

583
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,280
Ye-in: So, how about me? What have you heard? Do I have manners?

584
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,280
Jun-bin: Have you heard that? That you're mannerly?

585
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:09,280
Ye-in: I hear I'm considerate, but people use "considerate" more for women than "mannerly".

586
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,280
Jun-bin: Is that so?

587
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:17,000
Ye-in: I try to make others comfortable because I like it, but I don't know how they feel.

588
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,280
Ye-in: Have you heard from others that you're very considerate?

589
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,280
Jun-bin: Have people around you said you're very considerate?

590
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:31,280
Ye-in: They say that, but later people like Ji-ae might say, "What manners do you have?" and so on.

591
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32

,280
Jun-bin: So, you don't have them.

592
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,280
Ye-in: Yes, I can't say anything. So, how am I doing so far?

593
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
Jun-bin: Perfect.

594
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,280
Ye-in: Perfect?

595
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,280
Ye-in: Hahaha.

596
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:47,000
Ye-in: Thank you. Well, let's introduce the bad manners texts we've received.

597
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,000
Production Team: Please look at page 10, page 10.

598
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,280
Production Team: On page 10, there's a special star.

599
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,280
Production Team: On page 10, with a star separately.

600
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,280
Ye-in: Then we'll move to part two after this,

601
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,280
Ye-in: and we'll do this, right?

602
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,280
Production Team: Yes, just look at page 10 then.

603
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:09,000
Production Team: You two take turns introducing the stories,

604
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,280
Production Team: introduce the stories and comment on whether they're bad manners or not.

605
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,280
Ye-in: Mm, yes.

606
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,280
Jun-bin: Are we reading this?

607
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,000
Ye-in: Yes.......

608
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:24,280
Production Team: Start with "Let's introduce the texts" and then take turns.

609
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,280
Production Team: I'll give you the mic back.

616
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:32,000
Ye-in: We've received a lot of stories, but Jun-bin, could you please read the first one?

617
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Ye-in: Yes.....

618
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,280
Jun-bin: This is from Mr. Lee Kyung-soo,

619
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,000
Jun-bin: [I went on a trip abroad with a friend.]

620
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Jun-bin: [My friend started chatting in English with some foreigners we met there.]

621
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Jun-bin: [I couldn't speak English, so I just stood there, doing nothing.]

622
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Jun-bin: [Curious about their conversation, I asked what they were talking about.]

623
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Jun-bin: [They said it was nothing much and didn't tell me.]

624
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,280
Jun-bin: [Is it rude of my friend to talk only in English with others and exclude me during our trip?]

625
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:02,280
Ye-in: But Jun-bin, you speak English well, don't you?

626
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:07,280
Jun-bin: I do speak English, and I also speak Russian, but this happens quite often.

627
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:12,280
Jun-bin: Looking at the situation, it feels rude to me, but honestly, I find myself in similar situations often.

628
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:17,280
Jun-bin: For example, when I travel to Russia or Russian-speaking countries, I'm the only one who can speak Russian.

629
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,280
Jun-bin: You can guess what's being said in English, but you can't guess in Russian.

630
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,280
Jun-bin: I keep getting asked.

631
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,280
Jun-bin: Even things I think are trivial, like when I say I'm going to the supermarket and they ask where it is and say they'll go too.

632
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,280
Jun-bin: How to get to the supermarket? The person would say, go this way, have a nice day.

633
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,280
Jun-bin: Then, my friend would ask me everything about that interaction.

634
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,280
Jun-bin: But I'm not a translator.

635
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,280
Ye-in: Right, right.

636
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,280
Jun-bin: It's impossible to explain every little detail.

637
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:53,280
Ye-in: Of course. Although I'm not very good at English, I can understand it enough to travel.

638
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,280
Ye-in: Sometimes I ask.

639
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,280
Ye-in: And I find it really fun to explain.

640
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,280
Jun-bin: Oh, because I speak English well?

641
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:07,280
Ye-in: I love explaining exactly what I heard to them, I'm the type who loves to explain everything from A to Z, maybe because I haven't traveled much?

642
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:12,280
Ye-in: I think the cases I thought of were more about work or related fields than travel.

643
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,280
Jun-bin: When traveling, you only use simple language, so it would have been okay to explain. Now that we talk about it.

644
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:22,280
Jun-bin: Can't you just say a few words in Russian?

645
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,280
Ye-in: Sure, 'Thank you.'

646
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,280
Jun-bin: Ah... 'Gracias'.

647
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,280
Ye-in: 'Gracias'?

648
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,000
Jun-bin: 'I love you'.

649
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,280
Ye-in: 'I love you'?

650
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,280
Jun-bin: Yes.

651
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,000
Jun-bin: You should ask what it means.

652
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Ye-in: What does it mean?

653
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,280
Jun-bin: 'Gracias' means beautiful.

654
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:43,280
Jun-bin: 'I love you' means I love you.

655
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,280
Ye-in: Wow! What? Please say it again.

656
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,000
Ye-in: What was it?

657
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,280
Jun-bin: 'I love you'.

658
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,000
Ye-in: I love you?

659
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,280
Jun-bin: I love you?

660
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,280
Ye-in: I love you.

661
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,280
Jun-bin: You.

662
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,280
Ye-in: You?

663
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,280
Jun-bin: You means you.

664
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,280
Jun-bin: I love you.

665
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,280
Ye-in: I love you, too.

666
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,280
Jun-bin: Yes.

667
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,000
Ye-in: I love you, too.

668
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,280
Jun-bin: Likewise.

669
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,000
Ye-in: Oh, me too, right?

670
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,280
Jun-bin: Yes.

671
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,280
Ye-in: [Everyone in the radio studio laughed.]

672
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,280
Ye-in: Hahahaha

673
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,280
Ye-in: Just... take it easy in the comments.

674
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,000
Jun-bin: Seems like we're being rude, aren't we?

675
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,280
Ye-in: They say we've caused a broadcast accident.

676
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,000
Jun-bin: Yes, yes.

677
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,280
Ye-in: Hey, who's flirting on air?

678
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,000
Jun-bin: Was this on air?

679
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,280
Ye-in: Yes.

680
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,280
Jun-bin: Oh, sorry.

681
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,280
Ye-in: Yes. The camera is rolling right now.

682
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,280
Jun-bin: Oh, I didn't know. I didn't know.

683
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,280
Ye-in: Yes, yes. I forgot for a moment too.

684
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,280
Jun-bin: Yes, yes, yes.

685
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,280
Ye-in: I love you. Yes.

686
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,280
Ye-in: It's fun because...

687
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,280
Ye-in: Being fluent in languages is a huge charm point.

688
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:31,280
Ye-in: And when you're abroad, women tend to...

689
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,280
Ye-in: Rely on someone like that, you know?

690
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,280
Ye-in: You know?

691
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,280
Jun-bin: Yes, yes.

692
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,280
Ye-in: But just like that, I love you.

693
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,280
Ye-in: When you do this.

694
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,280
Ye-in: Then, wow.

695
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,000
Ye-in: "Jun-bin-kun is so cool." That's how it goes.

696
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,280
Jun-bin: That's a good tip. Oh.

697
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,280
Ye-in: Yes. But then again, he didn't answer when I went.

698
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:52,280
Jun-bin: So, in the case of a conversation during a trip, it's right for me to inform,

699
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,280
Jun-bin: But is that friend right?

700
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,280
Jun-bin: Are they not on good terms?

701
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:59,280
Ye-in: Right. If you're talking with foreigners you met locally and can't join the conversation,

702
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,280
Ye-in: It's not just about asking directions again, but understanding the ongoing

703
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:08,000
Ye-in: conversation. If it's like this, you do feel left out.

704
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,280
Jun-bin: Traveling really lets you know a lot about a friend.

705
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,000
Ye-in: Right.

706
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Jun-bin: It's a really good thing, I think.

707
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Jun-bin: This, in reality, isn't about not informing,

708
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:22,280
Jun-bin: but the friend being too engrossed in talking with a foreigner and wanting to talk a lot.

709
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,280
Jun-bin: You see your friend every day in Korea.

710
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,280
Jun-bin: But abroad, they might get a bit carried away.

711
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,000
Jun-bin: That friend.

712
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Ye-in: I think this is rude.

713
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,280
Ye-in: What do you think?

714
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:39,280
Jun-bin: It depends on the situation, not exactly rude but something that could be resolved through conversation.

715
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,280
Ye-in: Ah, a matter for discussion.

716
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,280
Jun-bin: Yes.

717
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:49,280
Ye-in: I chose it as rude, and Jun-bin-kun thinks it might be good to have a conversation as a solution.

718
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,000
Ye-in: It wouldn't hurt to try talking it out.

719
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,280
Ye-in: If you talk honestly, the friend might say, "Oh, I didn't realize."

720
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,280
Ye-in: And then they might be more considerate.

721
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,280
Ye-in: Yes. That's right.

722
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,280
Jun-bin: Yes, that's correct.

723
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:04,000
Ye-in: Yes. Let's move on to the next story.

724
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,280
Ye-in: From Ppoglee.

725
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,280
Ye-in: [I've never been in a relationship.]

726
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,280
Ye-in: [I complained to my female friend, wondering why I can't get a girlfriend.]

727
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,280
Ye-in: [She said there are people who like your style.]

728
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,280
Ye-in: [And that people like you become popular as they age.]

729
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,280
Ye-in: [I'm in my mid-30s.]

730
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,280
Ye-in: [Is she telling me to stay single until my 40s?]

731
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:24,280
Ye-in: [And is it rude of my female friend to say this without intending to date me?]

732
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,280
Ye-in: Either give me hope or don't.

733
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,280
Jun-bin: Totally rude. This person is.

734
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,000
Ye-in: Ah, this one is definitely rude.

735
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,280
Jun-bin: The worst manners on Earth.

736
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,280
Ye-in: Ah, the worst manners on Earth.

737
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,280
Jun-bin: Yes, yes, yes.

738
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,280
Ye-in: Which part exactly?

739
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,280
Jun-bin: Saying people like you are popular and then not dating.

740
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,280
Jun-bin: It's like giving hope. This person is.

741
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,280
Jun-bin: So giving hope like that is rude.

742
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,280
Jun-bin: You can say such things.

743
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:49,280
Jun-bin: In fact, this friend Ppoglee likes the person who said this. In reality.

744
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,280
Jun-bin: This female friend.

745
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,280
Ye-in: Ah, Ppoglee likes this female friend.

746
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:58,280
Jun-bin: Likes her, so "Why can't I get a girlfriend?" is like a confession. This is.

747
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:02,000
Ye-in: Wow, I never imagined that subtext.

748
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,280
Jun-bin: These shy people often think they're good at confessing. There are many memes about confession attacks.

749
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,280
Jun-bin: They think they're good at confessing, but.

750
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,280
Ye-in: Confession villain.

751
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,280
Jun-bin: They're really not good at confessing. The real villains are just 1%, and.

752
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:17,280
Jun-bin: Most people like me can't really confess and just probe around.

753
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,280
Jun-bin: "This conversation came up. Let's fit in here."

754
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:26,280
Jun-bin: What does it mean? They text friends asking, "She said this, what does it mean?" "What does this mean?"

755
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,280
Jun-bin: Then the friend would say, "Hey, what are you confessing for?"

756
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,280
Jun-bin: "That's practically saying let's date." That's what friends say.

757
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,000
Jun-bin: Then you go confess, get rejected, and come back.

758
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,280
Ye-in: But I want to give a somewhat boring consolation.

759
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:48,280
Ye-in: Normally, two people liking each other's actions is hard not because it's Jun-bin or anyone else,

760
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,280
Ye-in: but because it's inherently difficult.

761
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,280
Ye-in: If it was easy, we'd all be happily married and dating

762
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:58,000
Ye-in: and living in love. But that's not the case, right?

763
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,280
Ye-in: Because everyone has their tastes, finding someone who matches perfectly is inherently difficult.

764
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:07,280
Ye-in: And in cases like this, it's the same. One side might like it, the other might not.

765
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,000
Ye-in: But think about it. Any answer to such a question feels bad.

766
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,280
Ye-in: "Why can't I get a girlfriend?" It's a negative question.

767
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:19,280
Ye-in: Even if you give a positive answer, it's hard to feel good about it.

768
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,280
Ye-in: How curious must a mid-30s single person be?

769
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,280
Ye-in: "Why is it like this? What's wrong with my life? I just want to experience dating, even holding hands."

770
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:44,280
Ye-in: Wasn't it a desperate question for this friend?

771
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,280
Ye-in: Oh, it could have been. Really wondering.

772
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,280
Jun-bin: How heartbroken. I'm not single, though.

773
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Ye-in: So, you're not single, right?

774
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Jun-bin: Yes, that's right.

775
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,000
Ye-in: You've been dating for a long time, even. Your girlfriend.

776
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Jun-bin: You know well? Why do you know so well? Anyway.

777
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,280
Ye-in: [Everyone laughed in the radio studio.]

778
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,280
Ye-in: Hahahahaha

779
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,000
Jun-bin: This person is so desperate

780
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:12,280
Jun-bin: Of course, in a normal situation, saying such things is neither rude nor polite, but just consoling.

781
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:17,280
Jun-bin: But given how desperate this person's situation seems, it feels a bit like giving false hope.

782
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:27,280
Ye-in: Okay. Got it. So, not just some lame consolation, but actually, "Please get married." Like suggesting blind dates.

783
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,280
Jun-bin: You should just give them a reality check. Actually.

784
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,280
Ye-in: Oh, really?

785
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,280
Jun-bin: Yes. Yes. Yes.

786
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,280
Ye-in: What if they get hurt?

787
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,280
Jun-bin: That can't be helped.

788
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,280
Ye-in: So, just tell them the reality?

789
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,280
Jun-bin: You have to tell them the reality. You can't just let them fantasize. You have to let them know the reality.

790
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,280
Ye-in: Why? Just go home and look in the mirror.

791
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,000
Ye-in: [Everyone laughed in the radio studio.]

792
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,280
Jun-bin: Are you talking about personality?

793
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,280
Ye-in: No, I mean, you can see personality in the mirror. Personality shows on your face, you know.

794
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,280
Jun-bin: Oh, I see.

795
00:35:51,280 --> 00:36:02,280
Ye-in: Yes. So, for example, if you're often angry, your eyebrows look angry, and if you don't brush your teeth well, your teeth are yellow. Your lifestyle and inner personality show on your face.

796
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,280
Jun-bin: So, you're saying to groom your eyebrows.

797
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,280
Ye-in: Yes. Yes. That's what I meant. I was talking about looking into the mirror of your heart.

798
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,280
Jun-bin: Ah, as expected. Ye-in is amazing.

799
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,000
Ye-in: Yep. The mirror of the heart. It's not about a one-dimensional mirror.

800
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,280
Jun-bin: Your insight is tremendous.

801
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,280
Ye-in: Yes. Yes. Yes.

802
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,280
Ye-in: In fact, what's most important is what's inside us.

803
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,280
Jun-bin: Yes. Yes. Yes.

804
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,280
Ye-in: Yes. You know.

805
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,280
Ye-in: But honestly, I don't think I could say that. Like that.

806
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,280
Jun-bin: I usually do. I have some single friends too.

807
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,280
Ye-in: So, if a single friend asks why they can't get a girlfriend, what do you say?

808
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,000
Jun-bin: I explain in detail that this and that part of their personality is a problem.

809
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Jun-bin: I tell them to improve these parts before dating, trying to flirt, or getting set up.

810
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,280
Jun-bin: That's how I talk to them.

811
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,280
Ye-in: Then what does your friend say?

812
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,280
Jun-bin: When I talk, they understand. To them, I'm a hero.

813
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,000
Ye-in: [Everyone laughed in the radio studio.]

814
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,280
Ye-in: Ah, right. You're a hero.

815
00:36:54,280 --> 00:37:00,280
Ye-in: Ah, this is difficult. So, Jun-bin thinks this is rude.

816
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,280
Jun-bin: Yes.

817
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,000
Ye-in: This insincere consolation.

818
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,280
Jun-bin: It's rude considering the person's situation.

819
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:11,280
Ye-in: I feel like I've lived a rude life. Kind of giving insincere consolations.

820
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,280
Ye-in: It could have been hurtful to them.

821
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,280
Jun-bin: That's right.

822
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,280
Ye-in: I'll try to be like Jun-bin in the future

823
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,280
Jun-bin: Considering the situation and talking like this.

824
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,280
Ye-in: Changing perspectives.

825
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,280
Jun-bin: Yes, yes, yes.

826
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:27,280
Ye-in: Nowadays, you're very popular, Jun-bin. Are you popular with girls around you in real life too?

827
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,280
Jun-bin: No.

828
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,280
Ye-in: Let's move on to part two and continue our discussion.

829
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,280
Jun-bin: Yes.

830
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:39,280
Ye-in: [Everyone laughed in the radio studio.]

831
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,280
Jun-bin: Is this not going out?

832
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,280
Producer: It's currently being broadcasted.

833
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,280
Ye-in: It paused for a moment.

834
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,280
Jun-bin: It stopped, this thing.

835
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,280
Ye-in: There was buffering.

836
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,280
Producer: It's just the screen.

837
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,280
Producer: Just refresh the page.

838
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,280
Producer: Should I get you more water?

839
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,280
Jun-bin: I have water.

840
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,280
Ye-in: Yes.

841
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,280
Producer: Ye-in is good at handling awkward transitions.

842
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,280
Ye-in: I've been surviving here for 10 years with that.

843
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,280
Ye-in: Yes.

844
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,280
Ye-in: Yes.

845
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,280
Ye-in: Yes.

846
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,280
Ye-in: Yes.

847
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:15,000
Producer: About the "look in the mirror" comment earlier, Jun-bin's expression was

848
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Jun-bin: My expression was caught earlier?

849
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Ye-in: [Everyone laughed in the radio studio.]

850
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Ye-in: I never say such things, but when you asked to give a reality check,

851
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Ye-in: I mentioned looking in the mirror of the heart, insightfully

852
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Jun-bin: You're good at wrapping things up.

853
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,200
Ye-in: I've made it this far with packaging.

854
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,000
Jun-bin: You're really good at this.

855
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,200
Ye-in: Hahahahaha

856
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,200
Jun-bin: Should you start a YouTube channel?

857
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,200
Ye-in: I tried YouTube, but it didn't work out.

858
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,200
Ye-in: [Everyone laughed in the radio studio.]

859
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,200
Ye-in: Can you appear on Jun-bin's YouTube channel?

860
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,000
Jun-bin: You can always come to mine.

861
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Ye-in: Really?

862
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,200
Ye-in: Then can I get permission from the company and go?

863
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,200
Jun-bin: If the company gets involved, it's a bit

864
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,200
Ye-in: The company doesn't get involved, just asking the company, "Can I go?" like that

865
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,200
Jun-bin: If it's natural

866
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,200
Jun-bin: Then it's fine

867
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,200
Jun-bin: Without having to send a preview or anything, just naturally

868
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,200
Jun-bin: If you come to mine, we have to travel

869
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,200
Ye-in: Shall we go on a day trip?

870
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,200
Jun-bin: Yes?

871
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,200
Ye-in: On a day trip?

872
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,200
Jun-bin: That's not a trip, that's an outing.

873
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,200
Ye-in: [Everyone laughed in the radio studio.]

874
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,200
Ye-in: Because there might be people who find it hard to stay overnight

875
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,200
Ye-in: How about designing a date course for those people, for a travel date course?

876
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,200
Jun-bin: A date course?

877
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,200
Ye-in: A travel course.

878
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,200
Ye-in: [Everyone laughed in the radio studio.]

879
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,200
Ye-in: I can't seem to speak.

880
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,200
Jun-bin: It's no different from the story we just heard.

881
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,200
Ye-in: [Everyone laughed in the radio studio.]

882
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,200
Jun-bin: Am I the rude one for misunderstanding?

883
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,200
Ye-in: [Everyone laughed in the radio studio.]

884
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,200
Jun-bin: You said it was a date course?

885
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:53,200
Ye-in: So, we're not dating, but we could design a travel date course for them,

886
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,200
Jun-bin: So, it's a travel date then.

887
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,200
Ye-in: On a day trip.

888
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,200
Ye-in: Wouldn't that be nice?

889
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,200
Ye-in: Ye-in is rude

890
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,200
Producer: Please return to page 6 for a moment.

891
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,200
Jun-bin: Are we starting right away?

892
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,200
Producer: Yes, we're starting.

893
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
Producer: We'll play the background music when you do the skit.

894
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,200
Ye-in: Yes....

895
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,200
Producer: Starting part two now.

896
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:31,200
Ye-in: You're listening to Jung Ye-in's Ten, I'm special DJ YengDi, Jung Ye-in,

897
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:37,200
Ye-in: Beside me is today's special guest, a man who seems smarter and more attractive due to his popularity,

898
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:42,200
Ye-in: GwakTube's Gwak Jun-bin, and we're conducting the "Champions League of Rudeness" segment.

899
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,200
Ye-in: This time, we're meeting a rudeness story brought to life through acting.

900
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:51,000
Ye-in: We've adapted a story from a lady, 'Anonymous Song'.

901
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:58,200
Ye-in: [I went on a date with a guy I met through a blind date and started dating after 2 weeks. We were still in the shy phase but enjoying thrilling dates.]

902
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,200
Ye-in: [He invited me over to his place, so I visited his apartment where he lives alone.]

903
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,200
Ye-in: [Jun-bin, can I come in?]

904
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:12,200
Jun-bin: [Yeah, come on in. Just sit there, I'm making delicious curry, so just wait a bit.]

905
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,200
Ye-in: [Okay, but it smells so good. Can I look forward to it? Hohohoho]

906
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:21,200
Jun-bin: [Of course, of course. Hahahahaha. It's all done. Here, enjoy. This is for you, my Ye-in.]

907
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,200
Ye-in: [Yeah, you too.]

908
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,200
Ye-in: [Mmm, wow, it's really delicious.]

909
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:31,200
Jun-bin: [Hahahahaha. Glad it suits your taste. Hahahahaha.]

910
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,200
Jun-bin: [Fart sound.]

911
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,200
Ye-in: [Huh? Didn't we just hear a strange sound?]

912
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,200
Ye-in: [Something broke, I heard it.]

913
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,000
Jun-bin: [I just farted. You must be comfortable around me, so it all came out. But it's an odorless fart.]

914
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Jun-bin: [It's a fart, but there's no smell.]

915
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:52,200
Ye-in: [Oh? Oh, so you farted. You farted while we were eating curry. Hahahahaha.]

916
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,200
Jun-bin: [You finished your meal already, did you like it?]

917
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:00,200
Ye-in: [Yeah, it was really delicious. Jun-bin, you're great at cooking, the best, the best.]

918
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,200
Jun-bin: [Then, since I'm the best man, should we kiss now that we're bored? Come here.]

919
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,200
Jun-bin: [Come here.]

920
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:10,200
Ye-in: [Wait, wait, wait. You just ate curry, and there are still food particles in your teeth.]

921
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:15,000
Jun-bin: [So what? We're just going to kiss now. Come here and touch lips.]

922
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,200
Ye-in: [No, wait, wait, wait.]

923
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,200
Jun-bin: [What's with the wait? Just come here.]

924
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:26,200
Ye-in: You should kiss.

925
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:31,200
Ye-in: [That day, we ended up kissing and are still dating now, but opinions are still divided.]

926
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,200
Ye-in: [Honestly, even if we're a couple, isn't it a bit off to fart while eating?]

927
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:41,200
Ye-in: [And isn't it a bit off to kiss right after eating, with food particles still in your teeth? Isn't that rude?]

928
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,200
Ye-in: First, they acted as a couple.

929
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,200
Jun-bin: Wow, you're really good at this.

930
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,200
Ye-in: It was good, right?

931
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,200
Jun-bin: Me?

932
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,200
Ye-in: Didn't we do well?

933
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,200
Jun-bin: Ye-in, you're really good at this.

934
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,200
Ye-in: You too, Jun-bin.

935
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,200
Jun-bin: Really?

936
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,200
Ye-in: Yes.....

937
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,200
Ye-in: It felt so real.

938
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,200
Jun-bin: Me?

939
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,200
Ye-in: Yes...

940
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,000
Ye-in: [Everyone laughed in the radio studio.]

941
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,200
Ye-in: Hahahahaha

942
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:10,200
Ye-in: If a boyfriend and girlfriend actually fart while eating like this,

943
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,200
Ye-in: is it okay? Absolutely not okay?

944
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:19,000
Jun-bin: Well, I think the length of the relationship matters here.

945
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,200
Jun-bin: If it's around 100 days, probably not okay,

946
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,200
Jun-bin: but from 200 days, maybe it's acceptable.

947
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:29,000
Ye-in: So, in this case, being just 2 weeks into the relationship, it's out of the question?

948
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,200
Jun-bin: 2 weeks is definitely crossing a line, but

949
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,200
Jun-bin: I personally have severe nervous colitis.

950
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,200
Ye-in: What colitis?

951
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,200
Jun-bin: Nervous colitis.

952
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,200
Ye-in: Yes, yes, yes.

953
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,200
Jun-bin: So, when I'm with my girlfriend, I become very sensitive and tense, which makes me fart easily.

954
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,200
Ye-in: What do you do then? Do you hold it in?

955
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:48,200
Jun-bin: I ask for understanding. I have this condition; can you understand? And once they do,

956
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,200
Ye-in: Ah.

957
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,200
Jun-bin: the fart bombs start coming.

958
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,200
Ye-in: So, like once every 5 minutes?

959
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,200
Jun-bin: Not that often, once every 30 minutes.

960
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,200
Ye-in: Every 30 minutes?

961
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,200
Jun-bin: Yes, yes.

962
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,200
Ye-in: Deadly farts?

963
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:03,200
Jun-bin: But if a guy 2 weeks into the relationship has this kind of illness and asks for understanding, what do you think?

964
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:09,000
Ye-in: I'd totally understand; farting is, after all, a natural bodily function.

965
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,200
Jun-bin: Do you fart then, in front of your partner?

966
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:16,200
Ye-in: I've been in a relationship at such a young age that I don't remember.

967
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,200
Ye-in: [Everyone laughed in the radio studio.]

968
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,200
Jun-bin: You've never been in a relationship, have you?

969
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,200
Ye-in: No, I have, I have. I have been in a relationship.

970
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,200
Jun-bin: In elementary school?

971
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,200
Ye-in: In middle school.

972
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,200
Jun-bin: Ah, I see.

973
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,200
Ye-in: Because I debuted in high school.

974
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,000
Jun-bin: So you've never dated around that time.

975
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,200
Ye-in: Yes.

976
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:36,200
Ye-in: Yes, so I never really had the dilemma of farting around a boyfriend because, in middle school, boys don't really stay long enough for that to happen.

977
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:40,200
Ye-in: Uh, there's no such worry about farting or not since relationships weren't that long.

978
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,200
Jun-bin: I see.

979
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,200
Ye-in: Have you farted around your girlfriend before?

980
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,200
Jun-bin: I fart around anyone I'm dating.

981
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,200
Ye-in: Really? How soon?

982
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:53,200
Ye-in: I also did it around 2 weeks in, but I ask for understanding like this, not while kissing and farting,

983
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,000
Jun-bin: There are farts during kissing,

984
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,200
Ye-in: What if it smells bad while kissing?

985
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,200
Jun-bin: If I feel a fart coming, I don't kiss.

986
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,000
Ye-in: Ah.

987
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,200
Jun-bin: I've never made that mistake.

988
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,200
Ye-in: So multitasking doesn't work.

989
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:08,200
Jun-bin: I've never made that mistake where I'm about to fart and then start kissing. If my stomach hurts, I don't initiate physical contact.

990
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,200
Jun-bin: But we've been talking about disgusting stuff for too long.

996
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:17,000
Ye-in: Ah, but if not for me, would that peck even have been a topic? We did talk about pecks, right?

997
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,200
Ye-in: How do you feel about pecking without brushing first?

998
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:29,000
Jun-bin: Right after eating... But, you might not know since you haven't been in a relationship,

999
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,200
Ye-in: Yes

1000
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,000
Jun-bin: it's the time when love's sparks fly, the first two weeks.

1001
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Jun-bin: You want to peck just from seeing each other's face, it's the time when skinship is most desired. Two weeks in,

1002
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,200
Jun-bin: So, really, and she even accepted it, despite saying wait a minute, wait a minute,

1003
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,200
Ye-in: Ah

1004
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,200
Jun-bin: People who dislike it won't accept it, not at all.

1005
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,200
Ye-in: Ah, that wait, wait, wait isn't a wait of dislike.

1006
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,200
Jun-bin: Just pondering for a bit, wait wait wait.

1007
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,200
Ye-in: Ah, I also kind of want to,

1008
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:57,200
Jun-bin: Want to, but it's a bit dirty but still nice, so the person in the story went for the peck.

1009
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,200
Ye-in: Yes

1010
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,200
Jun-bin: So, it's a gray area.

1011
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,200
Ye-in: Ah, gray area. Ah, if both parties are okay with it, then it should be fine.

1012
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,000
Jun-bin: Yes

1013
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Ye-in: Right, if both are fine with it, I think it's like this,

1014
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,200
Ye-in: Maybe it would be okay 10 minutes after eating? After eating and having some water.

1015
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:20,000
Jun-bin: That's why, you know, when you're about to have skinship, you don't always brush your teeth,

1016
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,200
Jun-bin: You don't say, 'I'll brush my teeth before we peck',

1017
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,200
Ye-in: Right, right.

1018
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,200
Jun-bin: So, whether you peck 10 minutes later or 1 minute later, there's always going to be some food residue,

1019
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,200
Ye-in: Right, right.

1020
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,000
Jun-bin: It's not like you're going to wipe it off with a tissue,

1021
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,200
Ye-in: Right, right.

1022
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:33,000
Jun-bin: So, I think as long as there's mutual understanding, it's an act that can be done.

1023
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:39,200
Ye-in: Right, there's no correct answer in love. Commenters are asking, 'What if spinach gets stuck?'

1024
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,200
Ye-in: 'What if you ate raw garlic?'

1025
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,200
Jun-bin: I doubt the peck would be powerful enough to pull out spinach,

1026
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,200
Ye-in: While pecking?

1027
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,200
Jun-bin: Yes, but it's only the second week,

1028
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,200
Ye-in: Right, not a vacuum cleaner.

1029
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:53,200
Jun-bin: So, farting might be wrong in the second week, but pecking is somewhat forgivable then.

1030
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,200
Ye-in: Ah, pecking is fine.

1031
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,200
Jun-bin: From around two months, you'd start saying, 'Ah, it smells, don't do it', but since it's only two weeks,

1032
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:02,200
Jun-bin: it's when love is really burning. You'd peck on the streets and such.

1033
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,200
Ye-in: Have you ever pecked on the streets?

1034
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,200
Jun-bin: Me? I don't think I have.

1035
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,200
Ye-in: You haven't.

1036
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:18,200
Ye-in: Ah, but it makes sense. Even if it's only been two weeks, if you really like each other, a peck is doable,

1037
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:23,200
Ye-in: but farting might have been a bit shocking for the girlfriend.

1038
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,200
Ye-in: But this, dividing it into manners or not, it's a physiological thing after all,

1039
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,200
Jun-bin: Yes, it's a bit ambiguous.

1040
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:33,200
Ye-in: It's ambiguous, but I think the reaction afterwards is what's important.

1041
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:40,200
Ye-in: If, after farting, you act too smug like, 'Ah, it's just a fart', I'd be pissed, but

1042
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,200
Ye-in: if you fart and then apologize,

1043
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,200
Jun-bin: Ah, that would be too cute.

1044
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,200
Ye-in: That would seem very cute, right?

1045
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,200
Jun-bin: Yes, it was very cute.

1046
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:50,200
Ye-in: [Everyone in the radio studio laughs.]

1047
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,200
Ye-in: How about that feeling? Just resolving it to this extent.

1048
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,200
Jun-bin: It seems totally forgivable.

1049
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,200
Ye-in: Yes, the reaction, exactly.

1050
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,200
Ye-in: Oh, I'm sorry.

1051
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:05,200
Ye-in: Reaching a consensus to this extent.

1052
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,200
Ye-in: [Everyone in the radio studio laughs.]

1053
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,000
Jun-bin: Trying to put myself in that situation, I get it.

1054
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:09,200
Ye-in: Yes, yes.

1055
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,000
Jun-bin: The storyteller is innocent.

1056
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,200
Ye-in: Right, this is innocent, innocent indeed.

1057
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:19,000
Ye-in: It's not rude, finding a middle ground would be nice.

1058
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,200
Ye-in: Let's move on to another story.

1059
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,200
Ye-in: Back to that

1060
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:32,200
Ye-in: It would be great if you, Jun-bin, could read the story from Yak-ing.

1061
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:37,200
Jun-bin: [Yak-ing went on a trip with a friend, but the friend didn't bring any skin lotion.]

1062
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,200
Jun-bin: [So, I lent mine, and throughout the week-long trip, my friend used my skin lotion.]

1063
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:47,200
Jun-bin: [I thought they would buy their own, but they used my cosmetics the entire trip. Totally rude, right?]

1064
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,200
Jun-bin: [Or am I being too petty?]

1065
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,200
Ye-in: What do you think?

1066
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,200
Jun-bin: This one's really tricky because for a week, it's not really a big deal for guys, we don't use much.

1067
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:05,200
Jun-bin: A week's worth doesn't make much of a dent; it's like a scoop's worth.

1068
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,200
Jun-bin: But still, I think I would've at least bought them dinner or something.

1069
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:15,200
Jun-bin: So, it's a bit of a dislike from me.

1070
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:19,200
Jun-bin: It's slightly disagreeable.

1071
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,200
Ye-in: Disagreeable?

1072
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,200
Jun-bin: Yes, yes, yes.

1073
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,200
Ye-in: Women might use expensive skin lotions.

1074
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,200
Jun-bin: Yes, yes, yes.

1075
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,200
Ye-in: And many women are serious about skincare.

1076
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:33,200
Ye-in: So if it was expensive, I probably would've bought my own lotion halfway through.

1077
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,200
Jun-bin: There seems to be a gender difference here.

1078
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:40,200
Jun-bin: For example, when I went to Cuba with Pani and Hong-chul, both didn't have skin lotion.

1079
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,200
Ye-in: Oh, I see.

1080
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,200
Jun-bin: Hong-chul's was confiscated, and Pani just doesn't use it.

1081
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,200
Ye-in: Oh, manly.

1082
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,200
Jun-bin: Yes, he just applies sunscreen diligently.

1083
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,200
Ye-in: Yes.

1084
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,200
Jun-bin: But I gave them mine, and it really didn't bother me at all.

1085
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,200
Ye-in: Right, right.

1086
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,200
Jun-bin: It's the mindset of, we're going to use it anyway, let's share.

1087
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,200
Jun-bin: And in exchange, I receive a lot of happiness from traveling together.

1088
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,200
Jun-bin: So, I've never had a problem with sharing skin lotion while traveling.

1089
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:08,200
Ye-in: Hmm, I haven't either. Most women usually bring their own stuff.

1090
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:14,200
Ye-in: I don't use expensive skin lotion, so I'm fine with giving it away for free.

1091
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:19,200
Ye-in: Go ahead, use it. Being stingy about it is petty.

1092
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,200
Ye-in: Especially if a friend forgot theirs, right?

1093
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,200
Jun-bin: But there are people who deliberately don't bring things.

1094
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:29,200
Jun-bin: I understand about the skin lotion, but when they don't bring other stuff...

1095
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,200
Ye-in: Like what?

1096
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,200
Jun-bin: Not bringing clothes.

1097
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,200
Ye-in: Then they'd go around naked?

1098
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:36,200
Jun-bin: Especially when traveling, there are many places with incompatible plugs.

1099
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,200
Ye-in: Right.

1100
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:42,200
Jun-bin: Many places don't use 220 volts, so they don't bring adapters and keep charging together.

1101
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:46,200
Jun-bin: Then, "Hey, let me charge too," gets a bit annoying.

1102
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,200
Ye-in: Right, right. They might have deliberately not brought it.

1103
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,200
Jun-bin: Yes.

1104
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:54,200
Ye-in: Because you, Jun-bin, are a travel expert.

1105
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:58,200
Ye-in: They might think you'd have everything, so they don't bother.

1106
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,200
Jun-bin: But I haven't really traveled with friends recently.

1107
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,200
Ye-in: Just for broadcasting.

1108
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,200
Jun-bin: Yes, yes. It's a bit sad, now that I think about it.

1109
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,200
Ye-in: Let's do a one-day trip with friends.

1110
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,200
Jun-bin: A trip with friends? A friendship trip?

1111
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,200
Ye-in: A friendship trip.

1112
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,200
Jun-bin: Oh.

1113
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:17,200
Ye-in: Like, lowering my age a bit, maybe something fun and cheap domestically.

1114
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,200
Jun-bin: Why should I build a friendship with Ye-in?

1115
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,200
Ye-in: Right, you don't do that, no female friends.

1116
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,200
Jun-bin: Why should I travel with a work colleague?

1117
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:30,200
Ye-in: Oh, that's really attractive. I like that.

1118
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,200
Ye-in: Oh, that's not bad.

1119
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,200
Jun-bin: Shall we go on a trip then?

1120
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,200
Ye-in: Not if it's like that, we won't go.

1121
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,200
Ye-in: Oh, good, good. There's no friendship trip, do a workshop they say.

1122
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,200
Jun-bin: A workshop, ah, I like workshops.

1123
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,000
Ye-in: Yes, a workshop.

1124
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Jun-bin: Learned a good word.

1125
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Ye-in: Shall we all go on a workshop?

1126
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Jun-bin: Why should I? Why should I go with BaeTen's production team?

1127
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,200
Ye-in: [Everyone laughs]

1128
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,200
Ye-in: We're all a family, right?

1129
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,000
Jun-bin: I only show up once a year.

1130
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,200
Ye-in: Like a holiday, right.

1131
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:03,200
Ye-in: Nice. This issue is not necessarily about manners but more about finding a consensus.

1132
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,200
Jun-bin: Yes, I think a solution can definitely be found for this.

1133
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,200
Ye-in: Yes, let's suggest at least one solution.

1134
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,200
Ye-in: [Everyone laughs]

1135
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,200
Ye-in: Let's read another story. Here's one from 'How Much Orange'.

1136
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,200
Ye-in: [I went to an exhibition alone.]

1137
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:19,200
Ye-in: [A couple asked me to take their photo.]

1138
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,200
Ye-in: [After taking lots of photos for them, I was about to ask them to take one of me,]

1139
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:28,200
Ye-in: [but as soon as they got their phone back, they said thanks and just left.]

1140
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:33,200
Ye-in: [Isn't it manners to offer to take a photo for someone who's alone after they've taken yours?]

1141
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,200
Jun-bin: This happens a lot when traveling abroad.

1142
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,200
Jun-bin: But I've encountered many who don't offer to take a photo in return.

1143
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,200
Jun-bin: It was always disappointing.

1144
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,200
Jun-bin: Koreans are really good at taking photos.

1145
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,200
Ye-in: Right.

1146
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,200
Jun-bin: Foreigners often don't take good ones.

1147
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,000
Ye-in: Really?

1148
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,200
Jun-bin: They make your legs look short, though I have short legs.

1149
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:51,200
Jun-bin: So even when I did get my photo taken, it wasn't great.

1150
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,200
Jun-bin: But, on the topic,

1151
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:02,200
Jun-bin: Offering to take a photo is more about being considerate than manners.

1152
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:07,200
Jun-bin: It's sensible to ask, and we shouldn't condemn those without that sense as ill-mannered.

1153
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,200
Ye-in: Right, right, that makes sense.

1154
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,200
Ye-in: It seems more a matter of sensibility than manners.

1155
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:17,200
Ye-in: But you travel alone often, right? How do you handle photos?

1156
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,200
Jun-bin: I rarely take photos because I'm usually filming.

1157
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,200
Ye-in: So how do you solve it?

1158
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,200
Jun-bin: I don't really take many photos.

1159
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,200
Jun-bin: Because the camera is always recording, everything is documented.

1160
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,000
Ye-in: Yes.

1161
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,200
Jun-bin: I don't take many photos, but when I do, I always ask foreigners.

1162
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,000
Jun-bin: But they never turn out well.

1163
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:36,200
Ye-in: Ah.

1164
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,200
Jun-bin: No country takes photos as well as Korea.

1165
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:43,200
Ye-in: In Korea, photos are taken just right, with toes aligned and legs looking longer.

1166
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,000
Jun-bin: They make your legs look longer.

1167
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:45,200
Ye-in: Right.

1168
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,200
Jun-bin: They take good photos.

1169
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,200
Ye-in: Yes.

1170
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,200
Jun-bin: Foreigners make me look like a third of my height.

1171
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,200
Ye-in: Ah.

1172
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,200
Ye-in: Uh.

1173
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,200
Jun-bin: Yes.

1174
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,200
Ye-in: Shall we read the next story?

1175
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,200
Ye-in: Here's one from 'Coco 38'.

1176
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,200
Jun-bin: [I'm living with a friend.]

1177
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:07,200
Jun-bin: [We rarely cook at home, so it takes a while to fill up the food waste bag.]

1178
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,200
Jun-bin: [I suggested freezing it because of the smell,]

1179
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:13,200
Jun-bin: [but my friend finds it too gross to keep it in the freezer and prefers leaving it outside.]

1180
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:21,000
Jun-bin: [Which is more ill-mannered: Storing food waste in the freezer with food or letting it stink up the kitchen?]

1181
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,200
Ye-in: This is really tough. What do you do normally?

1182
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,200
Jun-bin: I bought a food waste disposer.

1183
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,200
Ye-in: The one that grinds it into powder?

1184
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,200
Jun-bin: It's the one that feeds it to microbes.

1185
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,200
Ye-in: Wow, wow.

1186
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,200
Jun-bin: Like keeping a pet, that's how I'm dealing with it.

1187
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,200
Jun-bin: PaniBottle recommended it to me.

1188
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,200
Ye-in: How is it? Did it improve your quality of life?

1189
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:41,200
Jun-bin: I hardly put food waste in it.

1190
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,200
Ye-in: Because you eat it all?

1191
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,200
Jun-bin: Yes.

1192
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,200
Ye-in: That's the best way.

1193
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:49,000
Jun-bin: But I used to keep it in the freezer.

1194
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Jun-bin: What do you do?

1195
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,200
Ye-in: I also keep it in the freezer.

1196
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,200
Ye-in: It takes too long to fill up, so I put it in the freezer, but not directly.

1197
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,200
Ye-in: I put the bag in another container and then freeze it.

1198
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:02,200
Ye-in: My mom suggested this, and it works well, especially in the summer.

1199
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:06,200
Ye-in: Flies gather quickly, and it smells really bad.

1200
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:09,200
Jun-bin: But even in the kitchen, if you keep it in a container,

1201
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:14,200
Jun-bin: it doesn't smell that bad.

1202
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,200
Ye-in: Even at room temperature?

1203
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:20,200
Jun-bin: Yes, but if you store it in the freezer in a container as mentioned,

1204
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,000
Jun-bin: the smell really doesn't spread much.

1205
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Ye-in: This is tough to resolve, isn't it?

1206
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,200
Jun-bin: It's not really about manners here.

1207
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,200
Ye-in: A matter of preference?

1208
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,000
Jun-bin: It's a matter of preference, but putting food waste directly in the freezer is a no-go.

1209
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,200
Ye-in: Yes, yes.

1210
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,000
Jun-bin: Keeping it in a container seems fine.

1211
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,200
Jun-bin: This is really difficult.

1212
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:40,200
Ye-in: You used to live off PaniBottle, right?

1213
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,200
Jun-bin: I lived off him for about a week or two, and Pani lived at my place for about 4 months.

1214
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,200
Ye-in: Why did that happen?

1215
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,000
Jun-bin: I'm not really the type to live off others well, but Pani likes living with someone.

1216
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,200
Ye-in: Ah, ah.

1217
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,200
Jun-bin: Even though he could afford his own place, he stayed with us.

1218
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,200
Ye-in: Ah, wanting to live together even if it means finding a place later.

1219
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,200
Jun-bin: I hinted a lot, asking if he found a place yet.

1220
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:03,200
Jun-bin: But he always said he would, staying longer than expected.

1221
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,200
Ye-in: You must be close.

1222
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,200
Jun-bin: Yes, we're like brothers.

1223
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:10,200
Ye-in: Any incompatible habits?

1224
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,200
Jun-bin: Everything was fine except for leftovers from broadcasting shoots.

1225
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,200
Ye-in: Yes.

1226
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,200
Jun-bin: He brings everything home.

1227
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,200
Ye-in: PaniBottle does?

1228
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:20,200
Jun-bin: Yes, a lot. Not that bringing things is bad, but he brings too much.

1229
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,200
Ye-in: Everything.

1230
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,200
Jun-bin: Yes, all sorts of things.

1231
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:32,200
Jun-bin: He can't stand seeing anything go to waste, bringing home hotel amenities and anything that's free.

1232
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,200
Ye-in: Yes, yes.

1233
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,200
Jun-bin: As a result, our fridge was always full.

1234
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,200
Ye-in: No space left.

1235
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,200
Jun-bin: Yes, yes.

1236
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,200
Ye-in: And when he brings stuff, he expects to share it.

1237
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,200
Jun-bin: Yes, let's eat together.

1238
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,200
Ye-in: Ah, let's eat together.

1239
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,200
Jun-bin: Yes.

1240
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:50,200
Ye-in: Interesting.

1241
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:53,200
Jun-bin: I realized you can really bring that much stuff.

1242
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,200
Ye-in: I leave everything behind.

1243
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,200
Ye-in: I don't really bring things with me.

1244
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:03,200
Jun-bin: I'm the same. I lose things if I'm holding them.

1245
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,200
Ye-in: Wow, me too, exactly.

1246
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,200
Jun-bin: How do we get along so well?

1247
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,200
Ye-in: [Everyone laughs]

1248
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,200
Ye-in: But really, living together is hard to reconcile.

1249
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,200
Ye-in: It seems to be a matter of taste. This issue, above all, requires a conversation.

1250
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,200
Jun-bin: Yes, yes.

1251
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,200
Ye-in: To find a compromise.

1252
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,200
Jun-bin: There are plenty of ways to solve this.

1253
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,200
Ye-in: Yes, let's just give one solution.

1254
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,200
Jun-bin: Search online for a container, like a 'Lock&Lock'. Oh, that's a brand name.

1255
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:26,200
Jun-bin: Get a sealed container; it really doesn't smell much.

1256
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,200
Ye-in: Good tip, seems like a good solution.

1257
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,200
Jun-bin: Yes, yes.

1258
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,200
Ye-in: Let's move on to the next story with this solution.

1259
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,200
Ye-in: 'Squid Game' says, [I'm a very casual guy.]

1260
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:43,200
Ye-in: [One day, I noticed my finger hair was too noticeable, so I borrowed an eyebrow razor from a colleague to trim it.]

1261
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:47,200
Ye-in: [She got mad, asking why I used her eyebrow razor for that.]

1262
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,200
Ye-in: [Honestly, I also trimmed some facial fuzz and slightly unshaven beard.]

1263
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,200
Ye-in: [Is this really such bad manners?]

1264
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,200
Jun-bin: Isn't that too much of a bad manner?

1265
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,200
Ye-in: But I think it's okay.

1266
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:03,200
Jun-bin: Are you just being contrary?

1267
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,200
Ye-in: No, no, no, because

1268
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,200
Ye-in: It's not like

1269
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:09,200
Ye-in: he trimmed nose hair with it.

1270
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,200
Jun-bin: But he used a female colleague's eyebrow razor to trim his finger hair.

1271
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,200
Ye-in: Is that so?

1272
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,200
Jun-bin: What I thought was,

1273
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,200
Jun-bin: Did this person only do this kind of behavior?

1274
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,200
Ye-in: Did he also use it for other purposes?

1275
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:24,200
Jun-bin: No, I was worried he might have done other rude acts.

1276
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,200
Ye-in: Like trimming armpit hair with it?

1277
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:30,200
Ye-in: That would be really bad manners; you'd have to buy them a new one.

1278
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,200
Ye-in: Or buy your own next time, but

1279
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,200
Jun-bin: Isn't it not about hair?

1280
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,200
Ye-in: Hmm, right, right, this is

1281
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:39,200
Ye-in: Right, but finger hair isn't dirty, right?

1282
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,200
Jun-bin: Is that so?

1283
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,200
Ye-in: Yes, finger hair.

1284
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,200
Jun-bin: I've never thought about it.

1285
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,200
Ye-in: Trimming finger hair and just wiping it with

1286
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:50,200
Ye-in: those small, like, alcohol swabs they used during COVID.

1287
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:54,200
Ye-in: Wipe it with alcohol and say it's disinfected. Is that too much?

1288
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:57,200
Jun-bin: But honestly trimming facial fuzz and beard with it?

1289
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,200
Ye-in: Oh, did he trim that too?

1290
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:03,200
Jun-bin: Honestly, along with a bonus of trimming here, thinking, "This much should be fine, right?"

1291
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,200
Ye-in: Oh, also trimming here with the razor.

1292
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,200
Jun-bin: Yeah, seeing what else he can get away with.

1293
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,200
Ye-in: I think finger hair is okay, but

1294
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,200
Jun-bin: But using it on facial hair and beard is too much.

1295
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,200
Ye-in: Ah, from a needle thief to a cow thief.

1296
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,200
Ye-in: Ah, then he might end up using it on armpits.

1297
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,200
Ye-in: Actually, finger hair is fine for me.

1298
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,200
Jun-bin: So, finger hair should have been stopped.

1299
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:23,200
Ye-in: Ah, ah, that makes sense.

1300
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:27,200
Ye-in: He should have been caught at finger hair.

1301
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:33,200
Ye-in: But really, why is finger hair okay for me?

1302
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,200
Jun-bin: Because that's just a pretense for actually wanting to trim his beard.

1303
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:40,200
Ye-in: Ah, really seducing with the finger hair but actually going for the beard.

1304
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:43,200
Jun-bin: Exactly. 'Devil's Plan.'

1305
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,200
Ye-in: So, it was actually the face he was after, seducing with the finger hair.

1306
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,200
Ye-in: So, what do we do? Is it bad manners?

1307
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:54,200
Jun-bin: This person should probably reflect a bit, don't you think?

1308
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:58,200
Ye-in: Right, just go to Olive Young next time, it's just a few thousand won.

1309
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,200
Jun-bin: I recommend buying about ten of them.

1310
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:06,200
Ye-in: Next time, buy your own or give one to the female colleague, especially since it's a sensitive item.

1311
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,200
Jun-bin: Right.

1312
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,200
Ye-in: Yes, just be a bit more considerate, thank you.

1313
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,200
Jun-bin: Yes, yes.

```srt
1340
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,200
Ye-in: Shall we read the next story?

1341
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:17,000
Jun-bin: [This is a famous debate on the internet.]

1342
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:23,200
Jun-bin: [Between Cheol-soo, who broke ten dishes while trying to help with the dishes, and Young-hee, who broke one dish trying to steal candy, who do you think is more mannerless?]

1343
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:30,200
Ye-in: Ah, it's tough. 'Handdrip' sent us this one, what do you think?

1344
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:33,200
Jun-bin: Wow, breaking ten is a bit much.

1345
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:38,200
Jun-bin: If it was five, I'd say Cheol-soo did well, but ten, and there might be a difference in cost too.

1346
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,200
Ye-in: Yes.

1347
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,200
Jun-bin: Dishes are expensive.

1348
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,200
Ye-in: Dishes are expensive.

1349
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:45,200
Jun-bin: Yes, I didn't know until I started living alone, but dishes are that expensive.

1350
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,200
Ye-in: They are expensive.

1351
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,200
Jun-bin: But Cheol-soo is such a warm-hearted person.

1352
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:54,200
Ye-in: Ten is a bit too much, according to the comments too.

1353
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:59,200
Jun-bin: But Young-hee isn't exactly a thief, it was just one candy.

1354
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,200
Ye-in: Ah, so is that action too cute? Is one candy forgivable?

1355
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,200
Jun-bin: Ah, but it's similar to the finger hair thing.

1356
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,200
Ye-in: Right, it's like going from a needle thief to a cow thief.

1357
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:09,200
Jun-bin: If forgiven, one might even steal the safe at home.

1358
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,200
Ye-in: Exactly. Right. Why steal? Just ask and eat.

1359
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,200
Jun-bin: Exactly.

1360
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,200
Ye-in: Why steal candy.

1361
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,000
Jun-bin: I think Young-hee did wrong.

1362
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Ye-in: Me too.

1363
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Jun-bin: She needs to be caught.

1364
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Jun-bin: For Cheol-soo, we should actually praise him so he thinks, "I need to live more diligently like this," realizing that he can be forgiven for doing good deeds.

1365
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,200
Jun-bin: And Young-hee, on the other hand, needs to be strictly taught not to steal again.

1366
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,000
Ye-in: Yes.

1367
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,200
Jun-bin: This seems like the right answer.

1368
01:02

:35,200 --> 01:02:36,200
Ye-in: Right.

1369
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,200
Ye-in: Exactly, this seems to be the right approach.

1370
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,000
Ye-in: Stealing someone else's belongings is wrong. And the broken dishes are a sign from god.

1371
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:44,200
Ye-in: It's a message saying, "Don't do such things in the future."

1372
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,000
Ye-in: Letting everyone know by breaking a dish.

1373
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,200
Ye-in: We'll wrap it up like this, everyone.

1374
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,000
Jun-bin: Yes.

1375
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,200
Ye-in: Let's summarize it like this.

1376
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,200
Jun-bin: We wrapped it up nicely.

1377
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,200
Ye-in: Yes, it fits well.

1378
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,200
Jun-bin: It really fits well.

1379
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,000
Jun-bin: We could do a segment together.

1380
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,200
Ye-in: That fits well.

1381
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,000
Jun-bin: Yes, so maybe we could do something once a month.

1382
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,200
Ye-in: That sounds good.

1383
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:07,200
Ye-in: Once a month, send Brother Seong-jae on a trip and just the two of us.

1384
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:11,200
Jun-bin: The two of us could go on a trip and do a radio show outdoors.

1385
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,200
Ye-in: Ah, just change the background completely.

1386
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,200
Jun-bin: Ah, yes yes yes.

1387
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,200
Ye-in: You said you don't travel with colleagues, right?

1388
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:20,200
Jun-bin: Ah, no, I thought you were avoiding colleagues, so I said it's about friendship.

1389
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,200
Ye-in: Ah, kind of like a workshop concept.

1390
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,200
Jun-bin: Yes yes yes, you went to a workshop, and I just did something too.

1391
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:28,200
Ye-in: [Everyone in the radio studio laughs.]

1392
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,200
Jun-bin: I said that because of my image.

1393
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,200
Ye-in: I know, I know.

1394
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,200
Jun-bin: Yes yes yes.

1395
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,200
Ye-in: I know, I know.

1396
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,200
Ye-in: What is Jun-bin lacking?

1397
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,200
Jun-bin: Yes, what?

1398
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,200
Ye-in: You're doing well.

1399
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:40,200
Ye-in: 'Royal9083' [It was just me and my younger sibling at home this weekend.]

1400


01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:43,200
Ye-in: [I woke up first and cooked the only ramen we had at home.]

1401
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:48,200
Ye-in: [Later, my sibling woke up, saw me eating ramen, and ordered jjajangmyeon for themselves.]

1402
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:52,200
Ye-in: [How can they order delivery food without asking if I wanted some too?]

1403
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,200
Ye-in: [Isn't this really mannerless?]

1404
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,200
Jun-bin: That's so cute though.

1405
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,200
Ye-in: You think it's cute?

1406
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,200
Ye-in: What do you usually do? Do you ask people around you when you order something?

1407
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,200
Ye-in: Do you usually order together?

1408
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:06,200
Jun-bin: Yes, I do, but doesn't the person who sent this story sound a bit childish?

1409
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,200
Ye-in: It is kind of cute.

1410
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:11,200
Jun-bin: Seeing me eating ramen and eating jjajangmyeon alone.

1411
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,200
Jun-bin: The tastes are similar, but ramen is delicious.

1412
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,200
Ye-in: I'm a bit worse.

1413
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:21,200
Ye-in: If my sibling is eating ramen, I ask for a bite.

1414
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,200
Jun-bin: Do they give you a bite?

1415
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,200
Ye-in: They give me a bite, my sibling is too kind.

1416
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,200
Jun-bin: Can't you finish a whole jjajangmyeon?

1417
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,200
Ye-in: I can't finish one.

1418
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,200
Jun-bin: I thought so.

1419
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:37,000
Ye-in: But I like to order multiple menus and eat them.

1420
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,200
Ye-in: Even if I'm alone, I order a half-and-half set of jjajang rice and sweet and sour pork.

1421
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,200
Ye-in: And I order jjamppong soup for 2,000 won extra and eat like that.

1422
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:50,200
Jun-bin: But not to force it, but I also like to order various things because it often appears in my videos.

1423
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:54,200
Jun-bin: I like to taste by ordering at least three things.

1424
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:58,200
Ye-in: Especially with Chinese food, if one of the three, jjajangmyeon, jjamppong, or sweet and sour pork, is missing, I can't eat.

1425
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,200
Jun-bin: Me too, me too.

1426
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,200
Ye-in: [Everyone in the radio studio laughs.]

1427
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,200
Jun-bin: Finding a new connection here.

1428
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:07,200
Jun-bin: So, about this story.



1429
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,200
Ye-in: Then, when we eat jjajangmyeon next time, let's eat together.

1430
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,200
Jun-bin: Since you can't eat much.

1431
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,200
Ye-in: Jjajangmyeon, jjamppong, and sweet and sour pork together.

1432
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,200
Jun-bin: Just a bite of each, so it's great.

1433
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:18,200
Ye-in: That sounds good, like we've found a jjajangmyeon mate.

1434
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,200
Jun-bin: This friend too.

1435
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:23,200
Ye-in: [Everyone in the radio studio laughs.]

1436
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,200
Jun-bin: The sibling could have asked the brother if he wanted some.

1437
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:28,200
Jun-bin: But there's often such squabbles between siblings.

1438
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:32,200
Ye-in: Do you have them? I don't have a brother, so.

1439
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:34,200
Jun-bin: I fought over such trivial things so much.

1440
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,200
Ye-in: Do you have a brother?

1441
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:42,200
Jun-bin: I have a brother, even over the computer, we fought fiercely over just 30 more minutes, even came to blows.

1442
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:46,200
Jun-bin: Fought over one more minute of a game, fought so much.

1443
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:50,200
Jun-bin: This can't be considered mannerless, it's just making siblings closer.

1444
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:54,200
Ye-in: Right, they're just living their own lives. It's not like they're giving money.

1445
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:57,200
Jun-bin: This is rather good. It's a common thing between siblings.

1446
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,200
Ye-in: Ah, this is nothing.

1447
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:05,200
Jun-bin: Royal9084 really just has a good brother, a good sibling, that kind of feeling.

1448
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,200
Ye-in: Got a normal sibling.

1449
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,200
Jun-bin: Too normal siblings.

1450
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:16,200
Ye-in: Uh, yes. Good. This is more of a natural phenomenon than about manners or manners.

1451
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:19,200
Ye-in: Yes, it seems okay. Ah, now I want to eat jjajangmyeon.

1452
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,000
Jun-bin: Shall we eat jjajangmyeon together after this (end)?

1453
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:26,200
Ye-in: Well, I have a performance tomorrow, so come watch my performance.

1454
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,000
Ye-in: [Everyone in the radio studio laughs.]

1455
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,200
Ye-in: Can you come to watch a colleague's performance?

1456
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,000
Jun-bin: Yes?

1457
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:32,200
Ye-in: At least that much.

1458
01:06:32,200 --> 

01:06:33,200
Jun-bin: Yes.

1459
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,200
Jun-bin: Good luck with your performance.

1460
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,200
Ye-in: Is that okay? Alright, thank you.

1461
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,200
Ye-in: Thank you.

1462
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:44,200
Ye-in: Then, let's try one more story and finish with the next one.

1463
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,200
Ye-in: There are a lot of stories here.

1464
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,200
Jun-bin: Shall we pick one?

1465
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,200
Ye-in: Shall we?

1466
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,200
Jun-bin: Shall we talk about dieting?

1467
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,200
Ye-in: Yes, shall we try?

1468
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:58,000
Jun-bin: [One of my friends succeeded in dieting.]

1469
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Jun-bin: [And now, every time we meet, they talk in detail about exercise and diet.]

1470
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Jun-bin: [I'm not interested, so I just let it go in one ear and out the other.]

1471
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Jun-bin: [My friend is upset.]

1472
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:12,200
Jun-bin: [Am I the mannerless one for not listening, or is my friend the mannerless one for only talking about uninteresting things?] KingGod General.

1473
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:17,200
Ye-in: Oh, dieting, dieting.

1474
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:24,200
Jun-bin: That friend keeps giving unsolicited advice on dieting, even to someone who isn't dieting.

1475
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:26,000
Jun-bin: Because I've succeeded in dieting.

1476
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Jun-bin: I don't think this is a problem with dieting. There's always that one friend.

1477
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,200
Jun-bin: When they succeed in something, they get obsessed.

1478
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,200
Ye-in: The bragging friends?

1479
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:36,000
Jun-bin: Too many friends who brag under the guise of giving advice.

1480
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Jun-bin: Many friends have succeeded in something.

1481
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,200
Jun-bin: They come and give so much unsolicited advice, it's stressful.

1482
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:45,000
Ye-in: I think so too.

1483
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:53,200
Ye-in: If the other person is curious, you can talk about it, but unsolicited advice or tips are a bit mannerless.

1484
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,200
Jun-bin: It's just bragging, not advice.

1485
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,200
Ye-in: It's satisfying their own ego.

1486
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:01,200
Jun-bin: By teaching, they can show off how great they are, so it's a huge mannerless act.

1487
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:05,000
Ye-in: And it's very hard for the listener.

1488
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,

200
Ye-in: Because I'm not interested, but listening also uses my time.

1489
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,200
Jun-bin: Speaking of which, I think I'm kind of like that.

1490
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:15,200
Ye-in: Ah, when you succeed in something, do you brag like, "I really did well"?

1491
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,200
Jun-bin: Not exactly "I really did well," but I do feel a bit upset if not acknowledged.

1492
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:21,200
Ye-in: Hmm, can you give an example of how detailed you talk?

1493
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,200
Jun-bin: It was really bad in elementary school.

1494
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,200
Jun-bin: Around 4th grade, I ranked first in my class.

1495
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:27,200
Ye-in: Ah, in studies?

1496
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,000
Jun-bin: I didn't have the image of being smart in elementary school.

1497
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,200
Jun-bin: Nobody acknowledged it.

1498
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,200
Ye-in: Yes, ranked first?

1499
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:34,000
Jun-bin: Yes, it was so upsetting.

1500
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,200
Jun-bin: So, I couldn't just say, "Actually, I'm the top ranked," so I went home and cried.

1501
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,200
Ye-in: To your mother?

1502
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,200
Jun-bin: I always do that to my mom.

1503
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,200
Ye-in: Saying I ranked first?

1504
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,200
Jun-bin: Now I have so much to brag about, so I talk a lot.

1505
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:47,200
Jun-bin: My mom seems to dislike it when I call now.

1506
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,200
Ye-in: Ah, asking you to be quiet?

1507
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:51,200
Jun-bin: If not my mom, who else would I talk to?

1508
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,200
Ye-in: Ah, right.

1509
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,200
Jun-bin: "I reached 1 million subscribers," who else would I tell?

1510
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:57,200
Ye-in: But, ah, right, that's possible.

1511
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:03,200
Ye-in: Somehow, I'm a bit shy about bragging.

1512
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:10,200
Ye-in: I guess I haven't really had much to brag about in life, so I haven't really bragged much.

1513
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,000
Jun-bin: You have so much to brag about.

1514
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Ye-in: Not really.

1515
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,200
Jun-bin: Debuting as a girl group is already a huge brag.

1516
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,200
Ye-in: Is it?

1517
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:21,200
Jun-bin: Yes, it's everyone's dream, and the viewers are fans of Ye-in.

1518
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,200
Ye-in: Ah, right.



1519
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:27,200
Ye-in: Ah, it's like something irresistible even to maternal instincts.

1520
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,000
Jun-bin: I do overdo it with my mom.

1521
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Ye-in: You can just get financial therapy for your mom.

1522
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,200
Jun-bin: I always give financial therapy, but it's not enough.

1523
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:39,200
Ye-in: Ah, I haven't been able to provide the financial therapy I wanted for my parents yet.

1524
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:42,200
Ye-in: So maybe that's why I haven't really bragged to my parents yet.

1525
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:46,200
Jun-bin: I haven't fulfilled it at all. I think there's no end to filial piety.

1526
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:48,200
Ye-in: A hospital?

1527
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:51,200
Jun-bin: I said it because I was being watched, mom is fully satisfied.

1528
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:55,200
Ye-in: Well, anyway, about these diet success stories.

1529
01:09:55,200 --> 01:10:01,200
Jun-bin: It's not about dieting, but because this friend is bragging under the guise of advice, it's really mannerless.

1530
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:04,200
Ye-in: Ah, yes, we need to talk honestly about this.

1531
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,200
Jun-bin: Right, right.

1532
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:06,200
Ye-in: I'm not interested in dieting.

1533
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,200
Jun-bin: Don't be upset, you're the one at fault.

1534
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:13,200
Ye-in: Talking like this, I think it's a bit mannerless.

1535
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:17,000
Ye-in: Wow, we read a lot more stories than I thought.

1536
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Jun-bin: It really was the champions league.

1537
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Ye-in: Right.

1538
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,200
Ye-in: Time has passed a lot, so after listening to the ads, it's time to say goodbye.

1539
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,200
Jun-bin: Oh, so quickly.

1540
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,200
Ye-in: Yes, we'll go listen to the ads first.

1541
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,200
Jun-bin: Yes.

1542
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,000
Jun-bin: Are we over time?

1543
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Production: Yes, we are over.

1544
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:39,000
Production: After listening to the ads, both of you can wrap up.

1545
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Ye-in: Just like this?

1546
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,200
Production: Yes, wrap it up and...

1547
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Ye-in: I heard today was fun, Jun-bin.

1548
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,200
Jun-bin: Honestly, it was fun not because of me, but because you hosted so well.

1549
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:57,000
Ye-in: Oh no, you were very entertaining.

1550
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,200
Jun-bin: I didn't do much.

1551
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,200
Ye-in: I'm kind of a fan myself.

1552
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,200
Jun-bin: That's not quite the case.

1553
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,000
Ye-in: [Everyone laughed.]

1554
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:13,200
Ye-in: No, because, in my daily life, I fill the void with interesting YouTube videos.

1555
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:16,200
Ye-in: And at one point, that void was filled by that

1556
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,200
Jun-bin: 'Wheel Mouth'

1557
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,200
Ye-in: 'Wheel Mouth' and

1558
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:19,200
Jun-bin: 'Professor Gwak's Meal'

1559
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,200
Ye-in: 'Professor Gwak's Meal'

1560
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:22,200
Jun-bin: Oh, I regret not having you on the show.

1561
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,200
Ye-in: You should invite me.

1562
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:24,200
Jun-bin: Didn't they invite you?

1563
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,200
Ye-in: No.

1564
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,200
Jun-bin: It was tough to get guests back then.

1565
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:32,200
Ye-in: Will you plug me in next time?

1566
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,200
Jun-bin: I don't have that power, but

1567
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,200
Ye-in: As a guest, as a guest.

1568
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,200
Jun-bin: As a guest, I do have some influence.

1569
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,200
Ye-in: Yeah, I want to speak up as a guest.

1570
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:42,200
Jun-bin: But the important thing is, I've already left that show.

1571
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,200
Ye-in: You're not doing it anymore?

1572
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:44,000
Jun-bin: Yes, yes.

1573
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Ye-in: Why?

1574
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,200
Jun-bin: I'm currently doing two new programs there.

157

5
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,200
Ye-in: You're doing another one? But 'Wheel Mouth', you're doing 'Wheel Mouth' again?

1576
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,200
Jun-bin: 'Wheel Mouth' has been handed over and is still going on.

1577
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:54,200
Jun-bin: If it's going well, you can't keep doing the same thing.

1578
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,000
Jun-bin: So they are still doing fun talk shows.

1579
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,200
Ye-in: I'm really grateful for having been a friend who shared my emptiness.

1580
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:05,000
Jun-bin: They are still doing it, so watch 'Waffle'. Although I'm not appearing anymore, it's still fun.

1581
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,200
Jun-bin: Please show a lot of love.

1582
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,200
Ye-in: I'll keep watching your activities, Jun-bin.

1583
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,200
Jun-bin: Are you going to watch 'Devil's Plan' when you get home?

1584
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,200
Ye-in: Yes, of course.

1585
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,200
Jun-bin: Yes.

1586
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:15,200
Ye-in: I'll see how dirty you played.

1587
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,200
Ye-in: Am I going to be like, "What? The guy I was just with, what's with his character?"

1588
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:21,200
Jun-bin: Where are you originally from?

1589
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:24,200
Ye-in: I'm from Incheon.

1590
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:27,200
Jun-bin: Ah, Incheon? But you often have a Gyeongsang-do accent.

1591
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:30,200
Ye-in: Ah, I kind of have that. Yes, I've heard that a lot.

1592
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:32,000
Jun-bin: I'm purely from Gyeongsang-do.

1593
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,200
Ye-in: Right. I think dialects are really a talent.

1594
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,200
Ye-in: Kind of like a special skill.

1595
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Jun-bin: Is that right? (Gyeongsang-do accent)

1596
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,200
Ye-in: Is that right? (Gyeongsang-do accent)

1597
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:44,200
Ye-in: I'm kind of drawn to people who can speak dialects.

1598
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,000
Ye-in: It's like the last time.

1599
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,200
Jun-bin: I ended up wrapping up the last part.

1600
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,200
Ye-in: Right.

1601
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,200
Ye-in: It's an honor.

1602
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:57,000
Production: We've listened to the ads.

1603
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:02,200
Ye-in: All the ill-mannered texts introduced in today's Non-dating Champions League will receive a 'Sunrise Portable Lantern'. Congratulations to everyone.

1604
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:06,200
Ye

-in: GwakTube's Gwak Jun-bin,

1605
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:07,200
Ye-in: how was your time with YengDi instead of BaeDi on YengTen?

1606
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:11,200
Jun-bin: I wish YengDi would continue, it was so fun and enjoyable.

1607
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:14,200
Jun-bin: It was very comfortable, and I had a great time.

1608
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:16,200
Ye-in: I had a great time too.

1609
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,200
Ye-in: Actually, this will probably be my last time as a radio DJ.

1610
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:22,200
Jun-bin: The honor of being the last one with me seems to add more meaning to it.

1611
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,200
Ye-in: Ending is important, right?

1612
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:30,200
Ye-in: I think it's great that we ended it so well with Jun-bin, and I feel really good about it.

1613
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:34,200
Ye-in: And if there's another opportunity, I'd like to visit again as a special DJ.

1614
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,200
Ye-in: Yeng...

1615
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,200
Ye-in: Yeng DJ.

1616
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:40,000
Ye-in: Wrapping up here, the last song will be 'You to Me, Me to You' by Jatanpung. We'll turn off the lights with this song. Dream with Ye-in.

1617
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:51,000
Production: Good work, everyone.

1618
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,200
Ye-in: You've worked hard.

1619
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:55,200
Jun-bin: You've worked hard.

1620
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:63,200
Ye-in: BaeTen is a radio show, but listening... it matches well with watching. That's the feeling.

1621
01:13:63,200 --> 01:14:00,000
Jun-bin: Did I use the expression watching? Did I?

1622
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,200
Ye-in: I did. Just now.

1623
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,200
Production: There are many viewers, too.

1624
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,200
Production: But you should listen to BaeTen.

1625
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,200
Ye-in: Right. BaeTen is for listening.

1626
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,200
Jun-bin: Listening, yes.

1627
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:12,200
Ye-in: It was really fun today.

1628
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:15,000
Ye-in: Jun-bin.

1629
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:20,000
Jun-bin: It would have been much stronger if it was an internet broadcast.

1630
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Ye-in: But since this is SBS public radio.

1631
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Jun-bin: I didn't hold back, though.

1632
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,200
Ye-in: Really?

1633
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,200
Ye-in: Is this the level of YouTube?

1634
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,200
Jun-bin: Yes. Just like I usually do.

1635
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,200
Jun-bin: I only held back on saying "masters of flirting" once.

1636
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:35,200
Ye-in: I saw that. You swear a lot. Like using vulgar language.

1637
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:39,200
Ye-in: So, that travel show, 'Marble World'

1638
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:41,000
Jun-bin: 'Marble World'.

1639
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,200
Ye-in: 'Marble World'. That game. 'Marble World'.

1640
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,200
Ye-in: I watched one, and you kept

1641
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,000
Ye-in: using broadcast-unfriendly words. The PD

1642
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Jun-bin: It's all acting. Acting.

1643
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,200
Ye-in: Acting? Ah. Acting.

1644
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:52,200
Ye-in: Right. Acting.

1645
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,200
Jun-bin: I reflected a lot after watching.

1646
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:57,000
Ye-in: You don't notice when you're using them, but when you see yourself...

1647
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Ye-in: You think, "I should fix this."

1648
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:05,000
Ye-in: What are you doing now?

1649
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,200
Jun-bin: Going to sleep. Now.

1650
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:09,000
Ye-in: Going home to sleep?

1651
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,200
Jun-bin: Yes. Yes.

1652
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,200
Ye-in: Do you usually go to bed early?

1653
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,200
Jun-bin: No. I play LoL and then sleep.

1654
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:16,000
Ye-in: Ah, LoL.

1655
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,200
Jun-bin: Yes.

1656
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Jun-bin: Is this still going on?

1657
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Ye-in: Yes.

1658
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,200
Jun-bin: [I really enjoyed 'Busan Country Boy'. Thanks, GwakTube.]

1659
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:27,000
Ye-in: [Everyone laughed.]

1660
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:33,200
Ye-in: You've worked really hard.

1661
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:37,000
Ye-in: Let's take a photo before you go.

1662
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:43,000
Ye-in: It's hot.

1663
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Jun-bin: Is that a phone?

1664
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Production: No, it's a film camera.

1665
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,200
Production: Brought it to take pictures.

1666
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,200

01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,200
Production: One, two, three.

1670
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Jun-bin: Will you give me the printed photo?

1671
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Production: Yes, we'll give it to you.

1672
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Jun-bin: I need to hang it at home.

1673
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,200
Ye-in: [Everyone laughed.]

1674
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:11,200
Ye-in: You've worked really hard.

1675
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,200

1679
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,200
Ye-in: Bye.

1680
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:23,200
Ye-in: See you in the live broadcast, everyone.

1681
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,200
Production: Shall we end it?

1682
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,200
Production: Just a moment.

1683
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,420
Production: Just turning off the sound.

1684
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:00,440
Production: We'll end it at 55 minutes, just keep it going like this.

1685
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:01,840
Production: It's still rolling, sis.
